                大约在一九八七年起，台湾政府对于校园实施了一连串的开放政策；以往对于学生管理相当的严格，禁止留长发，禁止男女在校园中交往，也不准去舞厅跳舞。开放之后，常常看到校园里成双成对的情侣，一到假日就和同学结伴去舞厅跳舞，通宵达旦。就在舞厅里，我认识了事件中的女主角，交往了一段时间之后，她怀孕了，而她最直接的决定是──堕胎。当时只觉得这样似乎不好，也曾反对过，但最后仍敌不过女朋友的坚持，陪伴着她去医院。短短的半小时，一条生命就这样消失了。过程中，我心如刀割痛苦万分，心里对这条生命有着万分的愧疚。这是发生在一九八九年四月的事，我没想到我还是个学生，二十岁不到，但我已荒唐地将一条生命带来人世，又无知地剥夺他生存的权利！</td>

                <p class="commentary4">From around 1987, the Taiwanese government started implementing a series of more permissive policies on campus. Before that, the regulations governing the students were quite strict. For examples, there were rules prohibiting students from growing their hair long, forbidding male and female students from having relationships on campus, and preventing students from going to dance halls. After the more permissive policies came into effect, couples could frequently be seen on campus, and during school holidays, students would go dancing with their friends all night long. It was in a dance hall that I met the main female lead in this story. After dating for a while, she got pregnant and she decided right away to have an abortion. Somehow, I felt getting an abortion wasn’t right, and I even voiced my opposition. However, at my girlfriend’s insistence, I finally gave up and accompanied her to a hospital. In merely half an hour, a life was terminated. While I was waiting for my girlfriend, I felt as if a knife were piercing my heart and I was in such agony. I felt terribly ashamed and guilty about the lost life. All this happened in April of 1989; I couldn’t believe that as a student less than twenty years old, I did a terrible thing and brought a life into the world, then ignorantly deprived him of the right to live!</td>

                约在结束后第六天晚上，我梦到一个小男孩手上拿着一把刀，恶狠狠地瞪着我；突然间，他用手上的刀挥向我的脖子，在我的脖子上留下了一道很深的伤口。梦中的我手捂着脖子痛醒，我心里明白这应该是那位被拿掉的孩子来报仇吧！从此以后，我常在凌晨四点胃痛痛醒，脾气越来越暴躁，身体越来越糟，甚至常常想动手打我的女朋友。当时，我不明白我的身体和心性怎么会这样；直到皈依宣公上人后，听到上人的开示，才知道“堕胎”的可怕。我尽力忏悔，拜佛、诵经咒，修诸功德，只希望那位“孩子”能原谅我。</td>

                <p class="commentary4">It was about the sixth night after the abortion that I dreamed about a little boy. He stared at me fiercely, with a knife in his hand. Suddenly, he thrust the knife at my neck, leaving a very deep cut. In the dream, I covered my neck with my hand, and I woke up from the pain. I knew in my heart that it was the aborted child who came for revenge! From then on, I often woke up from stomach-aches around four o'clock in the morning, and my health started to decline. I also got more and more irritable to the point that I frequently wanted to hit my girlfriend. At that time, I didn’t understand why my body and mind became like that. It was not until I took refuge with the Venerable Master Hua that I realized how terrible abortion was. I tried my best to repent and reform, bow to the Buddhas, recite Sutras and Mantras, and cultivate various merits and virtues. I only hope that “the child” would forgive me.</td>

More importantly, I wish to encourage young people to learn how to control their desires, concentrate on their studies, and be mindful of the admonitions from their teachers and elders. Sometimes we think those admonitions are old wives’ tales and ignore them, feeling that we can manage everything just fine. Actually, once a big mistake has been made, it is very difficult to correct.
