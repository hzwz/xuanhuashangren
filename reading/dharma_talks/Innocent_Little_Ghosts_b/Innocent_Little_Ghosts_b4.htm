                  The offense of abortion is very serious. You may think this is just a little ghost, but it has great spiritual powers that can cause you to die or catch various strange diseases, make you feel baffled and confused to the point of a mental breakdown.... The offense of abortion is greater than the offense of killing an adult.  If you do not want to raise a child, why cause the conception? Why be so messed-up? Unfortunately, because man and woman don’t understand the principles of how to be a human being, these problems arise.</p>

                  The Venerable Master: The proper behavior between man and woman is the foundation of peace within a nation and peace in the world. If a husband acts unlike a husband, a wife acts unlike a wife, and children act unlike children, how can the world avoid being in disorder? I suggest that everyone should fulfill the proper roles of husband and wife, do not get a divorce, and take good care of your children. With every family happy and harmonious, the nation will naturally be in peace.&nbsp;</p>

                  In addition, I urge everyone to stop having abortions! Think about it, if living beings become resentful spirits even before they are born, with these vengeful little ghosts of aborted fetuses everywhere, how can the society be peaceful? These little ghosts can only be crossed over by genuine cultivators of the Bodhi Way who are not greedy for wealth. These little ghosts are really tough to deal with! It is very difficult to resolve these matters; hence, with karmic offenses pervading everywhere, how can there be peace?</p>

                  上人：这个不能谈到“供养”，因为他不是佛，不是法，不是僧。你要是供养他，那就落邪见。那么超度还可以，超度不是供养，超度令他离苦得乐。但是这个冤孽若深了，也不容易解开这个结，因为这是夺命的一种债务，就要用夺命来还，所以是很不容易解的。虽然不容易解，你若遇到不贪财的真修行人，还可以有机会超度他们的。</p>

                  The Venerable Master: The term “Making Offerings” cannot be used in this context, because an infant spirit is not the Triple Jewel (the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha). If you consider making offerings to infant spirits, you will fall into the trap of erroneous views. Rather, it should be called “crossing over.” Crossing over living beings is not the same as making offerings to them, because the act of crossing over enables them to leave suffering and attain bliss. However, the infant spirits’ resentment is so great that they are difficult to appease. Given that the debt owed to these spirits involves taking lives, it needs to be repaid with life. However, if such debtors encounter genuine cultivators of the Bodhi Way who are not greedy for wealth, they still have a chance to cross over the infant spirits.</p>

                  问：现在有很多人借婴灵敛财，有些佛教人士颇不以为然。请问师父您的观点如何？婴灵是否会造成当事者身体不健康，或带来其他方面的困扰？让一些堕胎的当事者因畏惧、害怕，结果花钱为婴灵买牌位。所以，请问师父您对这方面的看法如何？婴灵是否会作怪？又该如何去调伏？才能够让婴灵安心？</p>

                  Questions: Nowadays, many people take advantage of others by claiming to appease infant spirits as a way to make money. Some Buddhists really frown upon this practice. Venerable Master, what is your opinion? Will infant spirits cause the individuals who owe them ill health or other problems? Some people who had abortions are scared into spending money to buy plaques for infant spirits. Venerable Master, what are your thoughts on this? Are infant spirits really able to cause trouble? If so, how do we subdue these spirits? How do we pacify and comfort them?</p>

                  上人：弄个牌位，不如没有位。什么叫没有位呢？根本就是不该去堕胎；不堕胎，就是不杀生；不杀生，就免得多此一举。至于，给婴灵弄个牌位，这叫舍本逐末，掩耳盗铃。能不能超度？是否可以解开这个冤债？这是不一定的。所以，与其悔之于后，不如防之于前；在未婚前，不要吃避孕药，也不要发生男女的关系……，为什么等不了呢？为什么要那么着急呢？为什么要那么馋呢？</p>

                  The Venerable Master: It would be better to have no plaque than to set up a plaque. What do I mean by this? One should not have an abortion in the first place; by refraining from abortion, one does not kill; by not killing, one doesn’t even need to set up a plaque. Setting up a plaque for fetus spirits is called “attending to the trifles and neglecting the essentials,” and it is like “covering up one's ears to steal a bell,” for one is deceiving oneself. Can those infant spirits be crossed over? Can the debts be settled? The answers are uncertain. Therefore, it is better to prevent problems from happening than to feel regret afterwards. Before one is married, one should not take birth control pills or have sexual intercourse. Why can’t you wait until you get married? Why are you in such a hurry?</p>

                  上人：这是对症下药一个最好的问题，可是这个问题很简单，很容易治的。青少年从什么地方来的？这些问题青年也是父母生的。不过，做父母的不会做父母，父而不父，母而不母；虽然生出子女，不以子女为重，以贪欢纵欲为自己的快活，所以只会生而不会教。我们男女效法欧风美雨，恣情纵欲，随便谈恋爱，随便追求异性，作为一个时髦的东西。一般人认为，如果男的没有一个女的朋友，这是一个白痴；女的没结婚之前，若没有一个男朋友，在西方来讲就认为是一个神精病，没人要！所以疯狂的恣情纵欲，那么生出子女，也不顾子女，只顾自己。那么结婚了二天半，三天也不够，就讨厌这个了，所以就离婚了。</p>

                  The Venerable Master: This is an excellent question for it deals with the right solution to our social problems. The problems you described are very simple, because they are very easy to solve. Where did these teenagers come from? These troubled youths have parents, don’t they? However, their parents don’t know how to be proper parents – a father does not behave like a father, and a mother does not behave like a mother. Although they gave birth to their children, their focus is not on the children; instead, they are greedy for pleasure and satisfaction of their sexual desires. Acting just to please themselves, they only know how to procreate, but know nothing about how to educate their children. Men and women in our country are emulating the trends in Europe and America, by indulging in emotional love and sexual desires, dating causally, and chasing after the opposite sex; they think they are being very modern by doing so. Most people think that if a man doesn’t have a girlfriend, he is an idiot. Similarly, if a woman doesn’t have a boyfriend before she gets married, she is thought of as a mental case, and nobody would want to marry her! Since these individuals crazily indulge in emotional love and sexual desires, they don't care about their children after the children are born; they only care about themselves. In this way, it can take as soon as two and a half days after their wedding for them to start disliking each other, and they end up in a divorce.</p>

                  After the divorce, their children are either without a dad or without a mom. Then, a judge decides that the child should stay three days with dad, and four days with mom. Since the couple no longer lives together, their child, no matter a girl or a boy, will go and live with dad for awhile. The dad will say: “Your mom is not fit to be your mom. She is not a nice woman, so I divorced her and found another woman. My present girl friend is the best, while your mom is the worst.” The child will think: “Oh, my mom is the worst!” When the child goes back to his or her mom's place, he or she ignores the mom, saying: “You are the worst.

Now I am going to tell you something whether you believe it or not: although it is only a little baby who has been aborted, this little ghost is even fiercer than a big ghost! Now cancer is fairly common in our society, and this illness is brought about by abortions. Since more fetuses get aborted, the number of little ghosts increases, and these little ghosts sprinkle poisons everywhere and cause disquiet among people. They think: “You made me die so early, I won't let you get away with it. I will also kill you!” Accordingly, we have a lot of strange and hard to cure diseases.
