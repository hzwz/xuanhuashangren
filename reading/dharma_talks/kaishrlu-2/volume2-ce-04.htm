                Take a look at this piece of wood: two tree trunks which have
				grown together. The upper and lower parts are stuck together.
				What is the reason for this? Countless eons ago, there was a man
				and a woman who were very much in love. Together they made these
				vows, &quot;In heaven may we be like two birds tied together to the
				same wing, and on earth may our roots intertwine.&quot; For this man
				and woman, it was love at first sight, and they got married.
				They had the same hobby: money. The man did whatever he could to
				earn the money, and the woman did her best to spend it, and they
				busied themselves with the game of making money and spending it. </td>

				可是，爱得太深，罪造得太重，生生辗转沈溺，堕落到畜生、饿鬼、地狱道。今已成草木，这两棵树干本来应是两棵，可是依然长在一起，缠绵不相舍离。你看！左根伸出一枝来交抱右根，右根又伸出一枝来拥揽左根。这就如同男女各自伸出胳臂，互相交抱。可见夙世痴爱之劣习，至今形成草木，犹不能舍！并且这两干之中，有一块石头。他们视若珍宝，究竟这是什么呢？原来是他们往昔银行存款的簿子。 </td>

				of wood was originally two separate tree trunks, but they have
				grown together and become hopelessly intertwined. You see? The
				left trunk is stretching out a branch to embrace the right
				trunk, and the right trunk is extending a branch to grasp the
				left one. It's just like a man and woman holding out their arms
				and hugging each other. From this, one can see that even in the
				form of trees, they cannot renounce the habit of infatuation
				carried over from their former lives! In addition, there is a
				little stone lodged between the two trunks, and they cherish it
				as a precious gem. What is it? It's their bank account book from

                由此可见，爱得太深，是多么地危险，这绝对不是开玩笑的。有人心想：“法师，你说这个法，我是不可能相信的，既没有根据，又不合乎逻辑，大概是你哄孩子，说梦话。”信不信由你，我也没有办法一定要你相信。因为这个法是很难说的。人迷恋到爱情上，不论你如何点醒他，他还是不能接受。天下最害人就是爱重情深，最高尚就是修清净道。人不是不知，但明知故犯，而不能出离旷劫之习气。 </td>

                <p class="commentary4">This shows how dangerous it is to love
				too deeply. It's not all fun and games. Someone might be
				thinking, &quot;Dharma Master, I simply cannot believe the Dharma you
				speak. You have no proof to back it up, and there's no logic
				behind it. Probably you're just putting us on as if we were
				children. It's just dream talk.&quot; Whether you believe or not is
				up to you, because I have no way to make you believe it. This
				Dharma is very difficult to speak. When people are confused by
				love, no matter how you try to wake them up, they cannot accept
				it. The thing that harms people most in the world is deep love
				and heavy emotion, and the most exalted thing is cultivating the
				way of purity. It's not that people don't know this. They know
				it, yet deliberately go against it, unable to extricate
				themselves from habits accumulated throughout countless eons. </td>
