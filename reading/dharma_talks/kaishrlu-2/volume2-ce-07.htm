				若不专心致志，学什么也等于没有学一样。参了二天半禅，就想去念佛；念佛念了半天，又想去学律；学律不久，又想学密。常把自己的目标弄乱，而不能专一。为什么不能专一？就因为向外驰求，脚踏两条船，不知到江北好？或江南好？这样就会自误一生。 </td>

				studying the Vinaya for a while, you decide to study in the
				Secret School. Since you keep changing your goal, you cannot
				concentrate. The reason you cannot concentrate is because you
				are seeking outside. You have your feet in two boats, and you
				can't decide whether you want to go north or south on the river.

                To investigate Chan, you must honestly put in the effort. First
				of all, you must practice sitting until your legs are
				compliant－until they don't hurt or cause any trouble. How can
				you get your legs to stop hurting? Is there a mantra you can
				recite to stop the pain? Is there a medicine you can take to
				keep them from hurting? No. You must endure the pain, and then
				they will become obedient and stop hurting. If you cannot endure
				it, and you move your legs and let them rest as soon as they
				start hurting, your legs will never become obedient because you
				are spoiling them. Whenever they hurt, you simply placate them
				as if placating an unhappy child. If the child knows his parents
				cannot bear to see him suffer, he won't be able to endure any
				suffering in the future. Your legs are just like a child; if you
				fear the pain, they will hurt all the time, even when they
				aren't supposed to hurt. That's because you've spoiled them
				rotten. </td>

				各位信佛的人，要研究真理，不要盲从。要“亲近有德，远避凶人”，凶人就是专门欺骗人；有德之人就是不欺骗人。无德的人专用奸诈手段，所以德存不住；唯独不欺骗人的人，才能日积月累地修功立德，故其德行存在。所以你们观察人就是从这儿着眼。不是单单在表面上看，说：“我看这人有德，是善知识。”根本没有确实的标尺。你必须要设身处地，真正了解那人才算。末法时代，人都犯了一种通病，就是好高骛远，以耳代目，听人家说什么好，就往那儿跑。跑到那儿，好不好也不知道，甚至被人骗了还不醒觉。学这种迷信财色，迷信风水，是非常可怜的。 </td>

				Don't blindly follow others. You should draw near virtuous

				所以我们信佛的人，不应该迷信，要破除迷信。什么是迷信？就是糊里糊涂地乱信，别人说什么就信，信迷了。“迷信”还不打紧，最怕是“信迷”，信那迷乱颠倒的外道。有人自作聪明，真的他不信，假的他反而去信，这就是“迷中之迷”，不认识真理，拿真当假，把假当真。好像这六个小孩，本来“找死成仙”是一种虚假骗人的方法，而他们却相信。若是教他们要修行才能成仙，恐怕他们就不相信了。所以世界上可怜的人很多，可怜的事也很多，一言难尽！ </td>

				This is a case of being confused within confusion. They don't
				recognize true principles. They take the true to be false, and
				the false to be true. For example, in the case of the six
				children, the theory that &quot;death leads to immortality&quot; is
				actually just a false claim meant to cheat people, but they
				believed it. If someone had told them they have to cultivate
