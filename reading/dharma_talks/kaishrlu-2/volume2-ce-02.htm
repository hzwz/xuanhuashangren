                When you sit in Chan, don't be greedy for flavorful Chan. What
				is flavorful Chan? It refers to the bliss of the Dhyanas. When
				you have been sitting just about long enough, you start
				experiencing a feeling of comfort and freedom, and you may feel
				kind of indolent. If you become greedy for this state of comfort
				and ease, it's not easy for you to go on and make progress. You
				will linger there, always trying to get back to the state of
				flavorful Chan. When the state goes away, you will chase after
				it, thinking, &quot;When am I going to have that kind of state again?
				In that state there was no self, no others, no living beings,
				and no life span; no afflictions, and no hassles. It was very
				blissful and very comfortable and free. I wonder when I will
				ever have that experience again.&quot; And you will just keep waiting
				for that flavorful experience to reoccur. Waiting, you forget
				all about applying effort. That's known as getting attached to

				breath has stopped, although you aren't dead. This is known as
				entering the Samadhi of the First Dhyana. It's different from
				sleep, so you shouldn't think that going to sleep is the same as
				entering samadhi. When you are sleeping, you continue to
				breathe, and you may even snore so loudly that it sounds like
				thunder to your neighbors. A Good and Wise Advisor can tell
				immediately whether or not your breath has stopped. If you say,
				&quot;I feel like my breath has stopped!&quot; that's false. You're faking

		      Why is a Good and Wise Advisor called a "clear-eyed person"? It's because he can take one look at you and know what your level of cultivation is. If you want to test him out, go ahead! But he won't pay any attention to you. A true Good and Wise Advisor will not be tested by you, and he won't tell you all the secrets just because you asked. You must draw near a Good and Wise Advisor for a long time, and then he may tell you, but not in a very obvious way. Sometimes he might use an analogy, or just say a few words. So you can't go around proclaiming, "We've all become Buddhas!" You would be telling a big lie and playing a huge joke, and in the future you'd fall into the Hell of Pulling Out Tongues. That's really pathetic!
