                我们人从无量劫以来，习气毛病太多了！不知悔改，也不知修行，所以习气一天比一天增加，智慧一天比一天减少，业障也一天比一天重。因为这种关系，人若想修行也不容易，想学好也不容易，想出家更不容易，有种种孽缘牵缠不清。在因地时不知不觉造了很多罪业，不怕因果报应，所以到想要修道时，四面八方的障道因缘都发生了。有的是家庭环境不许可，有的是国家环境不许可，有的是个人所行所作发生种种障碍，而不能修行。 </td>

                From limitless eons in the past until now, we have had too many
				bad habits and faults. We haven't known how to repent and
				reform, and how to cultivate, so day by day our bad habits
				increase, our wisdom decreases, and our karmic offenses grow
				heavier. As a result, if we want to cultivate, it's not easy. If
				we want to learn to be good, it's also not easy. If we want to
				leave the home-life, it's even more difficult. We cannot break
				free of the various retributions which bind us up. Not fearing
				the retribution, we unknowingly planted causes that created a
				lot of offense karma. So now that we want to cultivate, causes
				and conditions arise from every direction to obstruct our
				cultivation of the Way. For some, it's the family situation
				which prevents them from cultivating. Some are prevented by the
				national circumstances. In other cases, the individual's
				behavior has generated all kinds of obstacles, making it
				impossible for him or her to cultivate. </td>

				所以真正想修道是难如登天，那么是不是说这么多困难就不修了呢？不是的。越难才越要修行，要勉为其难。若是不从困苦艰难中打筋斗打出来，始终是破不了业障关，所以才要修忍人所不能忍的功夫，让人所不能让，行人所不能行，做人所不能做的事，吃人所不能吃的，受人所不能受的，能如此地日积月累，才能把善功德增多一点，罪孽减少一点，使智能天天增长，业障天天减轻。 </td>

                <p class="commentary4">Therefore, if you truly want to cultivate, it's as hard as ascending to the heavens. Now, if it's that difficult, does it mean we shouldn't cultivate? Not at all. The more difficult it is, the more we have to cultivate. We must overcome the hardship. If we don't take a flying somersault to escape from our distress and difficulty, then we will never be able to break through our karmic obstructions. So we have to cultivate the ability to endure what others cannot endure, to yield where others cannot yield, to practice what others cannot practice, to do the things that others cannot do, to eat what others cannot eat, and to put up with what others cannot put up with. In that way, over the days and months, we can increase our wholesome merit and virtue a bit, and reduce our offenses and evil deeds a bit. Day by day, our wisdom grows, and our karmic obstacles become lighter. Since we accumulated the karmic obstacles bit by bit in the past, now we have to reduce them bit by bit. It's like when the weather turns cold, each day is colder than the day before, until winter has arrived. When the cold reaches the utmost point, the weather starts warming up again. But it doesn't warm up instantly. Each day is warmer than the day before, and gradually the hot weather arrives. The hot weather represents the time when our karmic obstacles have been lessened, and the cold weather represents the time when our karmic obstacles are heavy. These are just analogies.

				无论哪一位愿意用功，我都愿意做你们各位的护法，来帮助你们用功。因为当初我想用功，但找不到一个好的地方用功，到处都有很多细节皮毛的事要做。譬如在禅堂，你要学会敲引磬、打钟板，到时当值、巡香，如何给人倒茶、喝茶、收茶杯，啰啰嗦嗦的一大堆。你想用功都用到喝茶、收茶杯上；用到巡香、当值上，用到敲钟板、鱼鼓这些皮毛上了，这些琐事最低限度要三个礼拜才能学会，而通常打七也不过打一两个礼拜，这些零碎的皮毛事就够你学的了。 </td>

				on cultivation, I couldn't find a good place where I could do
				it. In every place I went, there was a lot of detailed,
				superficial work that had to be done. For example, in the Chan
				Hall, you had to learn to use the handbell, hit the boards,
				serve as a proctor who makes rounds, pour tea for people to
				drink, collect the teacups－a whole bunch of fussy details. You
				wanted to apply effort, but all your effort went into the
				trifling matters of serving tea, collecting teacups, making
				rounds as a proctor, and hitting the bell, boards, wooden fish,
				and drum. These petty jobs took at least three weeks to learn,
				and usually the Chan Session only lasted one or two weeks. These

				答：这个问题很重要。因为现在的人都中了钱毒，钱上有一种钱癌毒，这种东西是很毒很毒的。魔无形中洒上这种毒，所以人一接触到钱，就忘了一切，父母也忘了，只知道钱，认为钱是最亲切的，而为钱造了很多罪业。乃至于佛教徒也想尽方法，不择手段，又讲风水，又求密法，贪心比一般不懂佛法的人更多，比天还大，这样子就叫末法。末法，就是没有人懂得道理。想要没有这种毛病，就要守万佛圣城的六大宗旨：不争、不贪、不求、不自私、不自利、不妄语，这六个条件能把末法邪恶的风气改变。不要以为万佛圣城的六大宗旨是很简单的，你们平常人不但没资格学，也没有资格听。我讲这六大宗旨是讲给三步一拜的行者（恒实、恒朝）听的，我看他们苦干到如此，若再不说点真法给他们听，就太可惜了。所以这六大宗旨是破邪知邪见的照妖镜、降魔杵。 </td>

                <p class="commentary4">A: This question is very important,
				because people nowadays have all been poisoned by money. There
				is a kind of cancerous poison on money, which is extremely
				toxic. Invisibly, the demons sprinkle this poison on the money,
				and so as soon as people come in contact with it, they forget
				everything. They forget even their parents, and the only thing
				they know is money. They regard money as their closest friend
				and create a lot of offenses for the sake of money. Even
				Buddhists will think of all kinds of schemes and will do
				anything to get it, including consulting geomancers and seeking
				secret dharmas. They are even greedier than ordinary people who
				don't understand the Buddhadharma－their greed is greater than
				the sky. This is known as the decline of the Dharma. The decline
				of the Dharma means that no one understands true principles. If
				we want to correct this problem, we have to uphold the Six Great
				Principles of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas－do not contend,
				do not be greedy, do not seek, do not be selfish, do not pursue
				personal benefit, and do not lie. These six requirements can
				reverse the deviant and evil trend of the Dharma-ending Age. You
				shouldn't think the Six Great Principles of the City of Ten
				Thousand Buddhas are that simple. Ordinary people are not only
				unprepared to study them, they are not even ready to hear them.
				It was for the cultivators of Three Steps One Bow (Heng Sure and
				Heng Chau) that I spoke these Six Great Principles. I saw how
				hard they were working and thought it'd be a pity if I didn't
				speak some true Dharma for them. These Six Great Principles are
				a demon-spotting mirror and a demon-subduing pestle for
				destroying deviant knowledge and views. </td>

				至于神通，不是求来的，而是修来的；就是修来的，也不能把它当作一回事。神通在佛教中不算一回事，只是雕虫小技而已，哄小孩子的一种戏法，根本不可拿它当一回事。学佛的人，如果有求神通的思想，就走错路了，根本就不是正信佛教徒了。 </td>

				knew how to perform somersaults, ascend to the heavens and enter

				were not visible to the eyes of ordinary people. They didn't

				But Great Master Xuanzhuang was an honest, down-to-earth
				cultivator. He didn't know how to do flying somersaults, or
				cause a big uproar in the celestial palaces. He only knew how to
				hide his talent and truly cultivate the Way. Relying on the
				three qualities of determination, sincerity, and constancy, he
				single-mindedly went to obtain the sutras, and dedicated himself
				to benefiting living beings. As a result, Sun Wukung and the
				others were moved to guard and support him. </td>
