Each living being in the Dharma Realm has its own nature. You have your nature, and I have my nature. For example, your temper is a bit bigger than mine, and my temper is a little deeper than yours. Would you say that they're the same? Pigs have pig-natures, horses have horse-natures, men have a masculine nature, and women have a feminine nature. Each kind has its own nature. Those who like to eat sweet things have sweet natures. Those who like sour things have sour natures. Those who are fond of hot flavors have hot natures. And those who prefer to eat bitter things have bitter natures. Cultivation is also bitter in nature. Trees have the nature of trees, flowers have the nature of flowers, and grasses have the nature of grasses. Each kind has its own nature, so we call it the nature of the Dharma Realm. Do you understand now? In the past, you thought that this referred to the nature of the Dharma Realm, but now I've explained it as the "nature of the living beings" in the Dharma Realm.

		      <em>The Avatamsaka Sutra says</em>, "The myriad dharmas are made from the mind alone." The Buddha is created by your mind. If your mind cultivates the Buddhadharma, then you will accomplish the Buddha Way. If your mind is delighted by Bodhisattvas, then you will practice the Bodhisattva Path and become a Bodhisattva. And if your mind wishes to fall into the hells, then you'll head in the direction of the hells, and eventually fall into them. That's why it's said, "The Ten Dharma Realms are not beyond a single thought."

		      <em>They shine upon each others' lotus thrones.</em> The light emitted by the Buddhas in this Dharma Realm shines on the Buddhas in other Dharma Realms; and the light of the Buddhas in those other Dharma Realm also shines on this Dharma Realm. The Buddhas are seated on lotus thrones, shining their lights upon one another and causing the earth to shake. Not only do their six sense organs emit light and shake the earth, their every hairpore emits light and shakes the earth. Furthermore, in each hairpore appear limitlessly and boundlessly many Buddhas in worlds as many as motes of dust. They all manifest in a single hairpore. And every one of the Buddhas emits infinite and boundless light. These lights do not obstruct one another. The lights mutually unite, and so we Buddhist disciples should also unite our light. There shouldn't be clashes between people. This "shining" means your light shines on me, and my light shines on you. The lights shine on one another, similar to the way the holes are mutually connected in the circular net canopy of the Lord of the Great Brahma Heaven. The multiple layers of his imperial net are infinite and inexhaustible. The first Dharma Realm, the Dharma Realm of the Buddhas, is also that way.

		      <em>Sentient beings when enlightened:</em> Bodhisattva is a Sanskrit word which translates as "enlightened sentient being" or "enlightener of sentient beings." A Bodhisattva is one who teaches all sentient beings to become enlightened. That's one explanation. Another explanation is that a Bodhisattva is an enlightened one among sentient beings. We have a share in both explanations; we can also become Bodhisattvas. Since we are living beings endowed with sentience, we can also become enlightened ones among living beings. Then we can use the enlightened principles to enlighten all other living beings. Similarly, a Buddha can be compared to a grownup, while we are like small children. Every day we must drink milk, and every day we must listen to the Dharma. Listening to the Dharma is especially helpful in making our good roots grow and bringing out our wisdom. Therefore, if you have the opportunity to listen to the Dharma, it will be worth more than any amount of money you could make. How fine it is if you can have the time to investigate the Buddhadharma!

		      I hope the people here will not travel too much. The reason I say this is because travelling is very dangerous. Have you noticed that there's always more than one death during every vacation or holiday? So if you take a trip, you risk being among the casualties. Americans really enjoy having fun and taking vacations. We Buddhists should turn this trend around. It would be better to spend our vacations investigating the Buddhadharma, reciting sutras and mantras, and bowing to the Buddhas.

	 	    菩萨，是有情中的一个觉悟者，觉悟中的一个明白者，明白中的一个修行者，修行中的一个实行者。“跳出尘埃”：你若不明白，就跳不出这个尘埃，因为这个尘太厚了，所以你跳不出去。你若觉悟了，这个尘埃就薄了，就跳出去了。跳出尘埃以后，怎么办呢？是不是就睡觉、吃饭呢？不错，还要睡觉、吃饭、穿衣服，可是不是单单就做这个工作，不是为这三个问题而生存，为着要行这个“六度万行”：六度就是布施、持戒、忍辱、精进、禅定、智慧。有人说：“我知道，这布施就是教人布施给我。”不是的！我们要布施给人，所以我们不要这个钱。钱，是最邋遢的一个东西，你要是和它接近得太多，那就是尘埃；你能不要钱，那是最清净了，就跳出尘埃了。

		      Among sentient beings, a Bodhisattva is an enlightened one. Among enlightened ones, he is one who understands. Among those who understand, he is one who cultivates. And among those who cultivate, he is one of true practice. If you don't understand, then you won't be able to <em>leap out of the dust</em>, because the dust is too thick. When you become enlightened, the dust has thinned out and you can leap out of it. What do you do after leaping out of the dust? Do you just sleep and eat? Well, you still have to sleep, eat, and dress, but those aren't the only things you do. You don't live for those three matters. Rather, you live in order to cultivate the <em>six perfections and ten thousand practices</em>. The six perfections are giving, holding precepts, patience, vigor, samadhi, and wisdom. Someone says, "I know what giving means. It means other people give me things."  Wrong! You should give to others. You shouldn't want money. Money is the filthiest thing, and if you stay in close proximity to it for too long, you will be defiled by it. If you don't want money, then you are very pure and can leap out of the dust.

		      Did you think it was easy to be a Bodhisattva? It's not that easy! Not only is it not easy to be a Bodhisattva, it's not easy to be One Enlightened to Conditions or a Hearer, either. What is it easy to be? It's easiest to become a ghost, to fall into the hells, or to become an animal. "Difficult" is another way to say "not easy." A Bodhisattva must undertake bitter practices which other people find difficult to undertake, and endure what others find hard to endure. He doesn't give up on doing those things which are not easy to do. One must always advance; one who is vigorous is a Bodhisattva. That's all there is to it. There's no other esoteric or wonderful method. If you can do the things that other people cannot do, then you are a Bodhisattva.

					（一）无明。他观察这个无明从什么地方来的？怎么会有无明呢？ <br>
（二）行。有了无明，就有行为，就有所表现了；有所表现，就有了识。 <br>

（三）识。识就是分别。行就是个有为法；有了有为法，然后就有分别心；有分别心，就有了麻烦了。  <br>

（四）名色。这个名色就是麻烦。一有了名，这是有名的麻烦；一有了色，就有色的麻烦。名色就是麻烦，麻烦就是名色。这个事情若讲起来更麻烦，不讲还没有麻烦，一讲就讲出麻烦来了。我没有这么说的时候，你根本就不知道，你没有这么多麻烦。我这一讲，你不懂，有个不懂的麻烦了。有不懂的麻烦，就想要懂；想要懂，这就有了六入了。 <br>

（五）六入。这个六入就是想要懂，想要明白，于是乎就生出眼根、耳根、鼻根、舌根、身根、意根，就生出了这六入。这六入为什么要生出？就是想要明白。孰不知，愈明白就愈
					糊涂，愈糊涂愈不明白，这就是六入。 <br>

（六）触。这触就是个碰。不明白，就要各处去碰，东碰、西碰、南碰、北碰、上碰、下踫，就好像那个乌蝇(苍蝇)似的，各处去碰壁。为什么要碰壁？就因为要明白。  <br>

（七）受。碰了之后，就有了受。没有碰壁，就觉得很舒服；一碰壁，就觉得很不舒服。没有人说我不好，我觉得很快乐；有人说我不好，我就觉得很不欢喜。这就是受。 <br>

（八）爱。有了领受，就生出一种爱着。我们人为什么有一种不平安的感觉？就因为有这种爱。有了爱，就有了恶，也就是有了讨厌。对于顺的境界，就生出一种爱着；对于不顺的境界，就生出一种厌恶。为什么有个高兴？为什么有个不高兴？就因为有一个爱，有一个恶。那个恶就是个不愿意、厌恶，所以这麻烦就一天比一天多起来了。  <br>

（九）取。对于你所要爱的东西，就生出来一个取。什么叫取呢？就是得着，想要得到。因为你爱，所以你就想要得到。  <br>

（十）有。你得到了，就满自己的这种欲望。那么为什么要满足自己的欲望？就因为想要有它，所以就有个“有”了。  <br>

（十一）生。因为有这个“有”，你想要得到属于你自己的。这一属于你自己的，就有了来生了。 <br>

（十二）老死。有了来生，就又有老死了。 <br>

      所以这十二因缘，是缘觉圣人所修的。

		      1.  Ignorance: They contemplate to see where ignorance comes from, and why it exists. <br>
2.  Activity: With ignorance, there is activity, and then there is manifestation. With manifestation, there is consciousness.<br>
3.   Consciousness: Consciousness refers to discrimination. Activity refers to conditioned dharmas. When conditioned dharmas arise, thoughts of discrimination arise. With thoughts of discrimination, the trouble comes. <br>
4.  Name and form: Name and form are the trouble. Name brings the trouble of name, and form brings the trouble of form. Name and form are the trouble, and the trouble is name and form. To talk about this matter is even more troublesome. Before I mentioned it, there was no trouble. But the mere mention of it brings trouble. Before I talked about this, you weren't even aware of it, so you didn't have that many troubles. Once I speak of it, since you don't understand, you have the trouble of not understanding. Because you have this trouble of not understanding, you wish to understand. With the wish to understand, the six sense organs come into being.<br>
5.   Six sense organs: The six sense organs come about because you wish to understand things; that's why the the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind arise. Why do the six sense organs come into being? Because of the desire to understand. But who would have known that the more you try to understand, the more muddled you get. The more muddled you become, the less you understand. That's the six sense organs.<br>
6.  Contact: Contact refers to touching or encountering. When we don't understand, we go seeking encounters everywhere: east, west, north, south, above and below, just like a fly that keeps bumping into the wall. Why do we seek encounters? Because of our desire to understand. <br>
7.  Feeling: After we touch something, there is feeling. Before we run into difficulties, we feel very comfortable. Once we encounter difficulties, we feel very uncomfortable. When no one criticizes me, we feel very happy. But if anyone says something bad about us, we get upset. That's feeling.<br>
8.  Love: When we have feelings, love and attachment arise. Why do people feel insecure? It's because of love. Once there is love, there is also hatred, or detestation. We like and cling to favorable situations, but detest adverse states. Why do we feel happy? Why do we feel unhappy? It's because we have feelings of love and hate. Hate refers to dislike and loathing. Because of these, our troubles increase day by day. <br>
9.  Grasping: When we see something we like, we want to grasp it. What is grasping? It is the action motivated by the wish to obtain something. Because you are fond of something, you wish to obtain it.<br>
10. Becoming: Once you obtain it, you have satisfied your desire. Why do you want to fulfill your desire? It's because you want to possess things. With that wish for possession, "becoming" occurs.<br>
11. Birth: Because of becoming, you want to possess things. Once    you want to possess things, there is birth into the next life.<br>
12. Old age and death: With another birth, there is also old age and death again.<br>
These twelve links of conditioned co-production are cultivated by Those Enlightened to Conditions.

		      Hearers are also called Arhats. They can fly through the air and manifest transformations, and they are endowed with spiritual powers. People who have realized a certain fruition in their cultivation will not casually say, "I have certified to the fruition; I have attained Arhatship." They cannot do that. When those who have certified to the fruition of sagehood walk, their feet don't touch the ground. They seem to be walking on the ground, but actually they are walking in air, and their shoes don't touch the ground. Even when it's very muddy, their shoes stay very clean. For example, even when the Venerable Fashun walked across very soft mud, his shoes didn't get muddied at all. That's a sign of one who has certified to sagehood.

		      Those of the first fruition have to sever the delusions of views. Those of the second fruition have to sever the delusions of thoughts. Those of the third fruition have to sever the delusions as many as dust and sand. As for ignorance, they have destroyed a bit of it, but they haven't pierced through it completely. They haven't exhaus-tively destroyed ignorance. Once they do, they will attain Buddha-hood. Even Bodhisattvas at the state of equal enlightenment still have a small amount of production-mark ignorance which keeps them from becoming Buddhas. What do the sages of the fourth fruition cultivate? They cultivate the Four Noble Truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the Way.

		      In the beginning, Shakyamuni Buddha first went to convert the five Bhikshus in the Deer Park. These five Bhikshus were the Buddha's relatives. They had been cultivating the Way with the Buddha, but some of them couldn't endure the bitterness. When Shakyamuni Buddha was in the Himalayas, he ate one sesame seed and one grain of wheat each day, and he became as thin as a matchstick. Three of his relatives left because they were starving and couldn't endure the suffering, and only two remained. Later, on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, a heavenly maiden made an offering of milk to the Buddha. When the Buddha drank the milk, his two remaining companions also left, saying, "Cultivation consists of ascetic practice. But now you have drunk milk. That shows that you can't cultivate. You can't take the suffering." Then they left. Those five people all went to the Deer Park.

		      After Shakyamuni Buddha was enlightened, he first spoke the <em>Avatamsaka Sutra</em>, but no people were able to hear it. Later, the Buddha bestowed the provisional for the sake of the real, and expounded the Agama Sutras. To whom did he speak? The Buddha contemplated: "Oh! I should first go and teach the five people who used to be my companions in cultivation."

		      In the past, Shakyamuni Buddha had made a vow, "If I become a Buddha, I will first save the people who have slandered me, killed me, and treated me the most badly." Who treated the Buddha the most badly? The <em>Vajra Sutra</em> mentions the King of Kalinga. When Shakyamuni Buddha was cultivating as the Patient Immortal in his former lives, the King of Kalinga dismembered that old cultivator's body. Why did he do that?

		      Because Shakyamuni Buddha stayed up in the mountains cultivating the Way, his body became covered with a thick layer of dust. Yet he never came out of the mountains; he remained there working hard and cultivating ascetic practices. One day the King of Kalinga took his concubines along as he went hunting in the mountains. The concubines were were fond of playing, and instead of following the King as he hunted, they went to play in the mountains. After the King returned from hunting, he went looking for his concubines. He discovered them all standing together, talking with a very strange-looking person. They were touching his hands and feet, and it looked very improper. He was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of jealousy. The King listened to what the man was saying. He was talking about cultivating the Way. The King of Kalinga was enraged, "Don't you be cheating my women! Just what kind of Way are you cultivating?" The old cultivator said, "I'm cultivating patience." "What do you mean by patience?" "Patience means that no matter who curses me or beats me, I don't get angry." "You say you can be patient? Is that for real or not?" "Of course it's for real." "All right, then let me test you out." The King of Kalinga drew his jeweled sword and hacked off the cultivator's hand. Then he asked, "I've cut your hand off. Are you angry?" The old cultivator said, "No, I'm not angry."

		      "Fine! You're not angry? Then you've really got some skill. But actually, you're just lying. You're angry inside, but you say you're not. Are you trying to deceive me! I'm a very intelligent person. Do you really think you can fool me? All right, since you say you can be patient, and not get angry, I'll cut off your other hand, too." The King cut the cultivator's other hand off, and then asked, "Are you angry now?" The old cultivator said, "I'm still not angry." Then the King of Kalinga raised his jeweled sword and sliced off the cultivator's two feet. Having cut off his four limbs, he asked, "Aren't you angry?" The old cultivator said, "I'm still not angry.  How can I prove it? If I'm angry at you, then my limbs will not grow back. If I am not angry, then my hands and feet will grow back, and I will be just as I was before. That will be proof that I have no anger." After the old cultivator (Shakyamuni Buddha in the stage of cultivation) spoke these words, his hands and feet actually did grow back as before.

		      When the gods, dragons, and the rest of the eight divisions of Dharma-protecting good spirits saw how the King of Kalinga had viciously cut off the old cultivator's limbs, they manifested their spiritual might and sent down hailstones to pelt the King. Seeing how devastating the consequences were and witnessing the old cultivator's spiritual transformations, the King knelt before the cultivator and begged to repent. The old cultivator then made a vow, "If I don't become a Buddha, then there's nothing to be said. But if one day I do attain Buddhahood, then I will first come and teach you to become a Buddha. If you don't get enlightened and become a Buddha, then I won't become a Buddha either. Therefore, after the Buddha attained Buddhahood, he went to the Deer Park to save Ajnatakaundinya first. The old cultivator was a former incarnation of Shakyamuni Buddha, and the King of Kalinga was a former incarnation of Ajnatakaundinya. Because the Buddha made that vow in his past life, he wanted to save the person who had treated him the worst.

"Displaying the provisional" means instructing by means of clever and skillful expedients.  Therefore, you shouldn't take them to be Hearers, followers of the Small Vehicle; don't look down on them. Not all of them are great Bodhisattvas, but some of them certainly are. Those Bodhisattvas of the Great Vehicle manifest as followers of the Small Vehicle in order to gather in those of the Small Vehicle, and then guide them to turn from the small toward the great. This is called "concealing the real and displaying the provisional."

		      The people of ancient China recognized the supreme lord, but did not know about the Buddha. In the Shang Dynasty, Emperor Tang used a black bull as an offering to the supreme lord and said, "I, Lu, but a small child, presume to use this black bull in venturing to make known to the Supreme Ruling Lord that if I have offenses, they are not the people's, and if the people have offenses, the offenses rest with me." Emperor Tang's name was Lu, and he referred to himself as a small child out of respect for the supreme lord. He earnestly told the Lord that if he made errors, the citizens should not be blamed, and that if the common folk of his country committed offenses, the responsibility should rest with the Emperor for not having taught them correctly.

		      The ancient sages and worthies would always blame and punish themselves, unlike people nowadays who, clearly knowing they are at fault, say, "Oh, I didn't have anything to do with it. It's all his doing." "It's his fault, so why are you blaming me?" "God, you're really unfair! Why is that person so rich, while I'm penniless? Why is he so honored, while I'm lowly?" They damn heaven and curse at people, never admitting that they are wrong, and only looking for the faults of others. The ancient sages always acknowledged their own mistakes.

		      In general, asuras refuse to listen to reason. They constantly lose their temper at everyone. If we take a closer look at the asuras, we find that five of the nine Dharma Realms contain asuras. In the Dharma Realm of animals, there are asuras among the birds and asuras among the beasts. For example, crocodiles are asuras in the aquatic world. There are also horse asuras. In a herd of horses, there may be one horse which causes a lot of trouble. That's known as "a horse which harms the herd." Most bulls are also asuras. The bovine nature is an asura nature. Dogs are even more prone to be asuras. People who raise dogs and spend a lot of time with dogs may also develop asura natures, so be careful! Don't run off to join the asuras.

		      There are good people and bad people. Human beings are harmonious by nature and can get along with anyone, so the verse says, <em>The way of people is harmony. / With merit and offenses interspersed.</em> People are neither completely good nor completely bad. If they were completely good, they would ascend to the heavens. If they were completely bad, they would become animals or hungry ghosts, or fall into the hells. They have a bit of merit, but they also have a bit of offenses. Either their merit exceeds their offenses, or their offenses exceed their merit. When a person's merit is greater than his offenses, he will be born in a rich and distinguished family, but with little merit and many offenses he will be born into a poor family. Between these two extremes are myriad differences and distinctions, based on the amount of good and bad karma each individual has created. People are neither totally yin nor totally yang. Those who are totally yin may become ghosts, while those who are predominantly yang will ascend to the heavens, instead of remaining as people. <em>On virtuous deeds you rise, offenses make you fall.</em> If you perform deeds of merit and virtue, you will ascend. If you commit heavy sins, you will descend. <em>It has nothing to do with anyone else at all.</em> Other people cannot make you fall into the hells, become a hungry ghost, or turn into an animal. That happens only because of the offenses you yourself committed. As it's said, "You commit the offenses yourself, and you also undergo the retribution yourself." That's the human realm.

		      Now, the realm of animals does not merely consist of only one kind of animal. There are billions of different species of animals. If you consider just the flying animals, there are already hundreds of thousands of myriads of varieties. Animals that walk and crawl are also quite numerous. They may be as small as mice, or as large as elephants. Deer, bears, horses, and cows are also large animals. These are all land animals, of which there are also hundreds of thousands of myriads of species. Aquatic creatures, such as seals, water buffaloes, and sea horses, are also infinite in variety.

They'll say that it's white. <em>Because they make what's black white,</em> they take what is not good to be good. This shows that they have no power of reasoning. So they're greedy for great quantities of everything. They're even greedy for something as filthy as dog excrement. The more they eat, the more aromatic and savory they find it. <em>They don't distinguish wrong from right.</em> They don't know what's right and what's wrong. They can't distinguish between right and wrong, because they're not clear about it. They don't have the ability to reason. Because of their greed, they become confused.

Let me tell you, if left-home people fail to cultivate according to the precepts established by the Buddha, they will fall even faster.

Just exactly what are ghosts? Ghosts are masses of yin energy which have shadow and no form, or form and no shadow. Sometimes you may see a dark shadow, but when you look closer it disappears. Perhaps you see what appears to be a person, but it vanishes in the twinkling of an eye. It's not easy to understand the principles behind such phenomena.

	 	    有的人说：“没有鬼。”我就告诉他，若没有鬼，也就没有佛，也没有人了，也没有一切的畜生了。因为畜生、人、阿修罗也是从鬼变的，乃至于天道、阿罗汉、缘觉、菩萨、佛，都是从鬼道上来的。为什么呢？因为这十法界不离一念心。这一念心，就造成十法界。你做鬼事，就堕落到鬼道去；做人事，就到人道去；做阿修罗的事，就跑到阿修罗里头去；你做阿罗汉的事，就跑到阿罗汉里边去；你做缘觉，就跑到缘觉里边去；你若做菩萨的事，就跑到菩萨的眷属里边去；你若做佛事呢，就成佛；你若做地狱的事，就堕地狱。所以这都是由你现前一念心造成的。

		      As to the people who say that there are no ghosts, I tell them that if there are no ghosts, then there are also no Buddhas, no people, and no animals. This is because animals, people, and asuras are also transformations of ghosts. The gods, Arhats, Those Enlightened By Conditions, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas all come from the destiny of ghosts. Why is this? It's because the Ten Dharma Realms are not apart from a single thought. This one thought creates the Ten Dharma Realms. By acting like a ghost, you fall into the realm of ghosts; by behaving like a person you can become a person. If you do the deeds of Arhats, then you join the ranks of Arhats. If you do the work of Bodhisattvas, then you become part of the retinue of Bodhisattvas. If you perform the deeds of Buddhas, then you'll become a Buddha. If you do hellish things, then you'll fall into the hells. So this is all created from the present thought of your mind.

	 	    “鬼类喜瞋”：凡是鬼的种类，就欢喜发火，生瞋恨心。对他好，他也生瞋恨心；对他不好，他也生瞋恨心。他最欢喜是什么呢？就是给其它人麻烦。你对他好，他也给你麻烦；你对他不好，他也给你麻烦，所以就说：“烧香引出鬼来了”，本来你烧香是恭敬他，可是他却给你麻烦，让你生病了。所以孔子讲：“敬鬼神而远之”，这鬼神你恭敬是要恭敬他，可是你不要和他接近，要离他远一点。

		      <em>The ghostly crew delights in hate:</em> Ghosts like to vent their tempers and get angry. If they are treated well, they get mad. If they are treated badly, they also get mad. What do they like to do best? They like to give people trouble. If you are good to them, they give you trouble. If you aren't good to them, they also give you trouble. There's a saying, "Lighting a stick of incense calls forth the ghosts." They come to bother you and make you get sick. So Confucius said, "One should respect the ghosts and spirits, but stay far away from them." You should certainly respect the ghosts and spirits, but don't get near them. It's better to keep them at a distance.

		      <em>Deluded by effects, confused about cause.</em> Since they aren't clear about the effects, and they don't understand the causes, they can't tell the difference between good and bad.

If you plant melons you will get melons; if you plant beans you will get beans. Since they don't understand cause and effect, they plant eggplant in the hope of harvesting hot peppers, or plant hot peppers and anticipate eating cucumbers.

	 	    地狱是最不快乐的一个地方，你们谁愿意到那个地方去旅行，我可以保证你即刻就会到。怎么样呢？你“愁一愁，地狱游一游；笑一笑，就老返少；哭一哭，地狱有个小黑屋。”你若是忧愁，这就种地狱的因。你若是笑，就种天堂的因。“自古神仙无别法，只生欢喜不生愁。”所以说，你能常常地笑，就老了也像年轻人一样。哭，这也是一个麻烦的事情。总而言之，“地狱忧苦”：地狱没有快乐的，是忧苦的。“无门自钻”：本来地狱没有门，地狱这个门是自己开的，你就硬往里钻，钻不进去也要钻。“起惑造业”：为什么到地狱去啊？就因为无明，因为不明白了，所以就造出一些个恶业来了。你造了什么业，就受什么果报，丝毫都不会错的，这是循环无端的，所以说“受报循环”。

		      The hells are the most miserable place. If any of you would like to take a tour there, there's a way which I guarantee will get you there instantly. What way? It is said,
				<p class="style1"><em>Depressed and melancholy, you roam through the hells; <br>
Happy and smiling, you enjoy eternal youth; <br>
Weeping and woe make a small dark room in the hells.
</em><p class="commentary4">If you becomes depressed, you are planting a seed for the hells. In contrast, if you smile, you plant a seed for the heavens. "From ancient times, the divine immortals have had no other practice than merely being happy and not being sad." So if you can always smile, then even when you're old, you'll still be youthful. If you cry, you give yourself a lot of vexation. To sum it up, <em>The hells' anxiety and suffering</em> are such that there is no happiness in the hells. They are melancholy and miserable. <em>Is devoid of doors, yet one bores right in:</em> The hells basically have no doors. You make the doors yourself, and burrow your way in by force, determined to get in at all costs. <em>Giving rise to delusion, deeds are done. / The retribution is borne in due accord:</em> Why do people end up in the hells? Because of ignorance and lack of understanding, they create evil karma. No matter what kind of karma you create, you have to undergo the corresponding retribution. The operation of cause and effect is never the slightest bit off. This cycle has no end to it.
