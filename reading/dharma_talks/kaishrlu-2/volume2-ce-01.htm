                During a Chan Session, everyone should understand the rules.
				Before the wooden fish is struck, no one should casually wander
				around. If you don't abide by the rules and follow instructions,
				then you are a transgressor of the rules. In the Chan Hall, the
				rules of the Chan Hall should be observed. After the silent sit
				is ended, the proctor should check and make sure everyone has
				put on his shoes before he hits the bell. When everyone has
				stood up, he should hit the wooden fish twice. Before the fish
				is struck twice, even if people have already stood up, they
				should not start walking yet. These are very simple rules which
				all of you should know. If you hit the wooden fish immediately
				after the sit is ended, before people have stood up, how can
				they walk? If you wait for another three minutes, that's fine.
				Some people's legs are numb from sitting, and they cannot even
				stand up, so how could they walk? These things are common sense
				in the Chan Hall, and everyone should know them. </td>

				我知道有几个人坐得腿痛，而哭起来，这是毫无用处，越哭就越痛，这腿不会说：“你哭了，我就不痛。”
				一般人以为我们这儿坐禅是很好的，其实是叫他们来受苦，所谓“很好”就是“很苦”。这儿一早两点多钟就起来，白天休息一个钟头，到晚上十二点钟才睡。每天只休息两三个钟头，可以说是不要命地来用功，这叫做“舍死换生”。</td>

				under the impression that sitting in Chan at our place is a very
				good thing. Actually, when they come here, they have to suffer.
				&quot;Very good&quot; means &quot;very bitter.&quot; We get up a little after two
				o'clock in the morning, rest for only one hour during the day,
				and don't go to sleep until midnight. Getting only two to three
				hours of sleep every day, you could say we're applying effort as
				if our life depended on it. That's called &quot;renouncing death and

                你受不得苦，就享不得福。你若想得到真正的功夫，必须忍苦耐劳，咬牙忍着腿痛。本来这个痛，可以不痛的，可是我们欢喜叫它痛，所以腿痛还是要忍着，所谓“忍人所不能忍”，就是忍这个。你痛了，若不能忍，还是考不上。你一定要把全身这种机关都破了，所谓“机关”，就是指你身上的痛，或哪儿不舒服，这些事情令你很烦恼，在这时候，你还能忍着，不生烦恼，这就是功夫；你若忍不住，那就考不上。所以有些人到这儿，连一天也受不了，就要跑。你们在这儿已经这么多天，也是很不容易的。 </td>

				get to enjoy blessings. If you want to attain true skill, you

				any pain. But we want there to be pain, so we endure it when our
				legs hurt. &quot;Enduring what people cannot endure&quot; is just enduring
				this. If you cannot bear the pain, then you still can't pass the
				test. You have to break through all the critical gates in your
				body. &quot;Critical gates&quot; refers to the points of pain and
				discomfort in your body that cause you a lot of affliction. At
				that point, if you can endure it and not become afflicted, just
				that is skill. If you cannot endure it, then you can't pass the
				test. Some people who come here can't even take it for a day
				before they want to run away. All of you have been here for so
				many days--that's not easy. </td>

                In cultivating, you must have &quot;patience with production&quot;--that
				is, you must be patient with what you cannot endure. &quot;Patience

				cessation of all dharmas. Even if you cannot endure, you have to
				endure. Don't be afraid of pain, and don't be running about
				everywhere, or you won't be able to attain samadhi. You must see
