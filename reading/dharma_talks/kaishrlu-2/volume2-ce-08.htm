                Q: Buddhism says that the first ancestor of mankind came from

				答：人是从光音天来的，这个来源不只七亿兆年，恐怕七亿亿兆年以前就有这种情形。光音天的天人来到人间，并不是那么完整，他们已失去智慧。为什么呢？这就等于我们人投胎又去托生一样。当初这个世界没有人类，尚未开化，混沌一片，如鸡蛋似的。天人好像苍蝇似的，飞到这世界来，以为有什么好吃的。从光音天到地球来，恐怕也要经过很长的时间才能到达。好像现在的卫星火箭，打入太空轨道，要经过人间很久的时间，或几年才能入轨道。同理，天人到地球来，本来没有什么目的地，他们各处旅行，把指南针丢了，到了地球就手忙脚乱。他们到了地球，也不像以往在天上那么聪明，他们仅存一种知觉性，不像在天上那么完整。好像人本来很聪明，但死了再托生做小孩，把前生的事就忘了。也像人撞车之后，失去所有知觉，变得迷糊混淆。 </td>

                <p class="commentary4">A: People came to the earth from the
				Heaven of Light-Sound. Their coming wasn't just seven hundred
				billion years ago. Perhaps such a situation already existed
				seven thousand trillion years ago. When the gods from the Heaven
				of Light-Sound came to this world, they were no longer that
				perfect and had already lost their wisdom. Why? For the same
				reason that people lose their wisdom when they get reborn. In
				the beginning, there were no humans in this world, and it was
				still undeveloped, an indistinguishable mass, like a chicken
				egg. The gods flew to the world like flies, thinking there was
				something good to eat here. To get from the Heaven of
				Light-Sound to the earth, they probably had to travel a long
				time, just as now it takes a long time for a satellite launched
				into space to enter its orbit, perhaps several years in human
				time. The gods didn't come to the earth for any special reason.
				They had been travelling and had lost their compass, so they
				were in quite a flurry when they got to the earth. When they
				reached the earth, they were not as intelligent as they had been
				in the heavens. All they had left was a perceptive nature. They
				weren't as perfect and whole as when they were in the heavens.
				In the same way, a person may be very intelligent, but when he
				dies and gets reborn as a child again, he will have forgotten
				all about his previous life. It is also like those victims of
				car collisions who fall into a coma and become totally
				stupefied. </td>

                至于所谓的“科学”，并不是什么科学，这是人取的一种代名词，叫它为“科学”。其实它只是一种理论、理性。这种道理圆满或不圆满？就要凭各人的见地和理解力。有些人懂得多点，有些人没学过科学，就不懂科学。那么是不是没学过科学的人，在他自性中就没有这种理性呢？不是的。不论你有没有学过科学，在自性里这个理性仍然存在。不能说学过科学，就有科学；没有学过科学，就没有科学。这就像佛性一样，人人自性中皆有。 </td>

                <p class="commentary4">As for the so-called science, there is no
				real thing called science. People just made up the name
				&quot;science&quot; and called it that. It's actually just a body of
				theories. Is this kind of reasoning perfect or not? It depends
				on each person's perspective and faculty of understanding. Some
				people understand it. Others have not studied science before,
				and do not understand science. Does that mean the people who
				haven't studied science before lack that kind of reasoning in
				their own nature? No. Regardless of whether you've studied
				science or not, that kind of reasoning exists in your nature.
				You cannot say that if someone has studied science, then he has
				the ability to understand science, and if he hasn't studied
				science, then he doesn't have the ability to understand science.
				It's the same with the Buddha-nature; everyone has it in his own

                Science is only a small part of the Buddha-nature, and it is not
				a very complete kind of reasoning. You may say people are doing
