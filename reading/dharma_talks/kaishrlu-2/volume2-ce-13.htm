				所以万佛圣城有禅、教、密、律、净五教，你愿意修什么都可以，是很自由的，不需要觉得不好意思。你想懒惰、睡觉也都是很好的事；懒惰，就不会去偷东西，这是持戒；睡觉，就不会去杀人或杀生，这也是持戒。你念佛、参禅，或学教、习律、修密，这都是持戒呢！所以你学五教，都是在持五戒，不杀生、不偷盗、不邪淫、不妄语、不饮酒。用功就不会犯戒，在表面上看来好像没有在持，其实这是不持而持，不戒而戒，不需要用持戒的名词，也在持戒，所以这样用功也是很好的。

                At the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, there are five different
				schools of practice: the Chan School, the Teaching School, the
				Secret School, the Vinaya School, and the Pure Land School, and
				you can choose to cultivate whichever you wish. You have a lot
				of freedom, and you shouldn't feel embarrassed. If you want to
				be lazy and sleep, that's good, too. If you're lazy, you won't
				go out and steal things, so you're holding the precepts. If you
				go to sleep, you won't murder people or take life, so you're
				also holding the precepts. If you recite the Buddha's name,
				investigate Chan, study the teachings, practice the Vinaya, or
				cultivate secret dharmas, you are also holding precepts! Thus,
				when you study in the Five Schools, you are holding the five
				precepts--no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no
				false speech, and no intoxicants. If you are working at
				cultivation, you won't violate the precepts. Outwardly, you
				don't appear to be holding them, but you are in fact holding
				them without trying to. Although you don't call it &quot;holding
				precepts,&quot; you are holding them. Therefore, applying effort in
				this way is also very good.

                Because of this, regardless of what you cultivate at the City of
				Ten Thousand Buddhas, you have a lot of freedom. No one will

				Way-place should be the most democratic of the democratic, and
				the freest of the free. So whatever you want to cultivate is
				fine, as long as you are able to &quot;pick it up&quot; and &quot;put it down&quot;
				when you culti-vate; that is, you work seriously, with
				single-minded concentration. That's the right way.

				再说说万佛圣城的六大宗旨：<br>
				（一）不争，就不会杀生。杀生就因争心作怪， 一争就你死我活，死伤无数。<br>
				（二）不贪，就不会偷盗。为什么要窃盗他人之 物？就因为贪。你要是没有贪心，就算人 家给你，你也不会要，所以要把贪心去除
				，才不会偷。<br>
				（三）不求，就不会有淫欲心。淫欲心就因为有 所求，女的求男朋友，男的求女朋友，都 是追求异性。不单求，还要“追”求，就
				好像把头削得尖尖的，往里头钻。若是无 所求，还有什么淫欲心？英俊的男人有什 么用？漂亮的女人也只是个盖肉的臭皮囊
				，有什么值得贪恋的？假若无所求了，淫 戒就不会犯。<br>
				（四）不自私，就不会打妄语。人打妄语，就因 为怕失去自己的利益，自私心作怪，所以 骗人撒谎，想令人不认识自己。<br>
				（五）不自利，就不会犯酒戒。人为什么喝酒？ 就想迷乱自己的身体心性，弄得它恍恍惚 惚，以为自己成了神仙，在天上逍遥。喝
				醉酒又会骂人，又会为所欲为，又增长淫
				欲心。有人想用酒来助血气流通快点，喝了酒可以忘记一切，好像抽鸦片烟一样过瘾。这都是自利心作怪，所以才去喝酒。

                As to the Six Great Principles of the City of Ten Thousand
				Buddhas: <br>
                1. If you don't contend, then you won't kill. Killing occurs
				because thoughts of contention take control. When you start
				contending, you have the attitude of &quot;Get out of my way or die!&quot;
				The casualties that result are beyond count.<br>
				2. If you are not greedy, then you won't steal. Why do you want
				to steal others' things? It's because of greed. If you are not
				greedy, then even if people want to give you something, you
				won't want it. So you should get rid of greed, and then you
				won't steal. <br>
				3. If you seek nothing, you won't have thoughts of lust.
				Thoughts of lust arise because you seek something. Women seek
				boyfriends, and men seek girlfriends. Not only do they seek,
				they plunge headlong into the pursuit as if nothing else
				mattered. If they didn't seek anything, then how could they have
				thoughts of desire? Of what use is a handsome man or a pretty
				woman? They are just stinking skin-bags containing flesh. Are
				they worth hankering after? If you seek nothing, you won't
				violate the precept of sexual misconduct. <br>
				4. If you're not selfish, then you won't tell lies. People tell
				lies because they're afraid of losing personal benefits.
				Overcome by selfishness, they cheat people and tell lies, hoping
				to hide their true face from others. <br>
				5. If you don't seek to benefit yourself, then you won't violate
				the precept against taking intoxicants. Why do people take
				intoxi-cants? It's because they want to mess up their bodies and
				confuse their minds, bewildering themselves to the point that
				they think they've become gods or immortals, enjoying
				them-selves in the heavens. Once intoxicated, they will scold
				people and do as they please, and their lustful desires
				increase. Some people also want to use intoxicants to speed up
				their blood and energy circulation. After taking them, they
				forget everything. It's as exciting as smoking opium. It's all
				because they are overcome by the wish to benefit themselves that
				they take intoxicants. <br>

                所以这六个宗旨，就是五戒的别名。为什么不说五戒？因为我们人听惯了五戒，你跟他讲：“不杀生、不偷盗、不邪淫、不妄语、不饮酒。”他说：“我知道了！听你的做什么？”所以把它变个名词，“不争、不贪、不求、不自私、不自利、不妄语”。这个名词本来人人也都听过，也都懂得，但是真能去做的少之又少，所以就再提醒大家：
				<p class="Style2">
                不争，就是不杀生；<br>
				不贪，就是不偷盗；<br>
				不求，就是不邪淫；<br>

                Thus, these six principles are just another name for the five
				precepts. Why don't I talk about the five precepts? It's because
				everyone is so used to hearing about the five precepts. If I say
				to a person, &quot;Don't kill, don't steal, don't engage in sexual
				misconduct, don't lie, and don't take intoxicants,&quot; he'll reply,
				&quot;I already know that! Why should I listen to you?&quot; So I changed
				the names to be: don't contend, don't be greedy, don't seek,
				don't be selfish, don't try to benefit yourself, and don't lie.
				Actually, everyone has also heard these terms before and
				understands them, but very few can truly practice them. That's
				why I'm reminding everyone:
				<p class="Style1"><em>Don't contend means don't kill; <br>
				Don't be greedy means don't steal;<br>
				Don't seek means don't engage in sexual misconduct;<br>
				Don't be selfish means don't tell lies; <br>
				Don't try to benefit yourself means don't take intoxicants.
