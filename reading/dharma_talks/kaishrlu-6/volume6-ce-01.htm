 The snake immediately responded by slithering into the hall from the front door without frightening anyone. Then it slithered from the left side of the hall to the right side, as if circumambulating the Buddha once. Finally, it settled down in front of the Dharma-seat, as if kneeling before the Buddhas with quiet dignity in order to listen attentively to the Dharma.

<p class="commentary">“一切众生皆有佛性，皆堪作佛。”这是佛亲口告诉我们的，但因众生妄想执著，故不能证得如来的智慧德相。从这句“一切众生皆有佛性”看来，就应该不杀生、不偷盗、不邪淫、不妄语、不饮酒，持这五戒。若杀众生，则与杀十方诸佛一样。盖一切众生乃是诸佛所示现，但因“一念不觉生三细”（即业相、现相、转相），便愈跑愈远，所以沉沦苦海，永失真道。这种道理是很浅显的，可惜被人忽略。</td>

<p class="commentary4">All living beings have the Buddha-nature and can become Buddhas. This is what the Buddha personally tells us, but because we have discursive thoughts and attachments, we cannot certify to the Buddha's wisdom and virtue. In view of the fact that all living beings have the Buddha-nature, we should refrain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and taking intoxicants, and we should uphold the five precepts. If we kill living beings, it's the same as killing the Buddhas of the ten directions. All living beings are manifestations of the Buddhas; however, since a single unenlightened thought produces the three subtle attributes (the attribute of karma, the attribute of manifestation, and the attribute of turning), the more we run, the farther off we stray, and so we sink and drown in the sea of suffering, losing sight of the truth forever. This is a very simple principle, but unfortunately people have overlooked it. </td>

<p class="commentary4">After its evil powers were defeated, the venomous dragon had no choice but to surrender. The Dharma Master taught the dragon that everything is characterized by suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and lack of self; only karma follows us. He urged the dragon to be compassionate and to use its powers to benefit living beings instead of harming them. After hearing the Dharma, the dragon suddenly had an awakening and attained the pure Dharma eye. The Dharma Master transmitted the three refuges and five precepts to it, and told it to cultivate the Dharma in a certain mountain cave and never trouble people again. The dragon gladly did as it was told.</td>

Fearing that it was a rattlesnake, we put it in a can with a firm wooden lid, and planned to set it free farther away in the woods, so that it wouldn't bother the residents. Who would have thought that when we opened the can, the snake was gone! Logically, there was no way it could have escaped. No wonder it's said to have spiritual powers!<span class="style3">”</span>]</td>

<p class="commentary">这条蛇我老早就认识它，二十多年前在香港大屿山慈兴寺，它常到庙上听经。虽然不曾恼害任何人，但是众生都害怕它的蛇形。一次有人也把它放到铁罐内，运送到几哩外的山林处，拟释放之，孰料打开罐子一看，蛇已不翼而飞！而今，佛法传到西方，它亦不惮远渡重洋，来美国护法。</td>

<p class="commentary4">I've known this snake for a long time. More than twenty years ago, it would come to Cixing (Flourishing Kindness) Monastery on Lanto Island in Hong Kong [a monastery founded by the Venerable Master] to listen to Sutra lectures. Although the snake never harmed anyone, people were scared because it was a snake. Once someone caught it in a metal can and took it into a forest several miles away to set free, but when that person opened the can, the snake was gone! Now that the Buddhadharma
has come to the West, the snake has also crossed the ocean, undaunted by the
distance, and come to America to protect the Dharma.</td>

<p class="commentary">学佛的众生要深信因果，不要种恶因，否则会结恶果；若种善因，一定会结善果。因果是丝毫不爽的，杀人之父，人亦杀其父；杀人之兄，人亦杀其兄。不要为了得到好处，而不择手段去杀人。你若害人，到最后反而是害了你自己。上天有好生之德，天不愿任何人做恼害众生的事，所以不要错因果。所谓：</td>

<p class="commentary4">Living beings who study Buddhism should believe deeply in cause and effect. If we don't plant bad causes, we naturally won't receive a bad retribution. If we plant good causes, we will certainly receive a good retribution in the future. The law of cause and effect is clear, and it never fails. If you kill someone's father, that person will kill your father. If you kill someone's brother, that person will kill your brother in turn. You shouldn't kill people just to gain benefits. Harming others merely harms yourself in the end. The heavens cherish life and do not want living beings to harm each other. Therefore, you should not go against the law of cause and effect.
