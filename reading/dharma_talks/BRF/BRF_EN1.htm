              <p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000">In the summer of 1975 Bill Brevoort, owner of Buddha Root Farm on the Smith River, near Reedsport, Oregon, decided he wanted to host an outdoors Buddha Recitation Session on his land. He requested the Venerable Master Hua and the fourfold assembly of Gold Mountain Monastery to join in the session. The Venerable Master assented, and in August 1975 a group of over fifty cultivators from all over the U.S. gathered at the farm to attend a week-long session of reciting the Buddha’s name.</font></p>                   
              <p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000">This was the first time that a traditional Buddha Recitation Session was held in the open air, in the mountains. A large main tent was set up to provide shelter from the hot afternoon sun and occasional downpours of rain. Beside the tent a circular path was cleared for members of the assembly to use during walking recitation. Beside the winding river, the yellow grasses, and the wild flowers the assembly recited the Buddha’s name, attended ceremonies, and listened to instructional talks.&nbsp;</font></p>                   
              <p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000"> The participants worked on quieting the mind; some attained the state of “light ease” or gained the flavor of Buddha Recitation. Ultimately, reciting the Buddha’s name can result in the Buddha Recitation Samadhi, a concentrated state where, as the classical Chinese poet Su          
              Dong-Po wrote:&nbsp;</font></p>                    
              <blockquote>          
                  <p class="verese_eng"><i><font color="#800000">Of the colors of the mountains,<br>

		In the sparkling streams and the forests green<br>                     
			his compassionate song is sung...&nbsp;</font></i></p>                    
              </blockquote>          
              <p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000">At the end of the week 17 people took refuge with the Triple Jewel and bowed to the Venerable Master as their teacher.&nbsp;</font></p>                   
				<p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000">During the session Venerable Master gave talks twice daily, one in the afternoon and another in the evening. He brought the Pure Land Dharma-door alive, explaining the fundamentals of practice and revealing the fruits of cultivation. He spoke so simply that even absolute beginners could comprehend the principles, and yet his words awakened more experienced cultivators to the profundities of the Buddhadharma. The Venerable Master’s words provided inspiration and instruction for all assembled at Buddha Root Farm, and they serve as a wealth of Dharma for cultivators of the future.</font></p>                    
              <p class="commentary_eng"><font color="#800000"><i>Vajra Bodhi Sea</i> will be printing the instructional talks given by the Venerable Master during that Recitation Session along with photographs, hoping to give our readers an idea of how the Master guided Westerners in the first outdoor Buddha Recitation Session and to remind them of the Master’s painstaking toil in bringing the Buddhadharma to the West. May this inspire everyone to take up the mission of the Thus Come One and carry on the Master’s wishes, thereby saving themselves as well as others.</font></p>

      How are you? This Dharma Assembly is wonderful! Despite the rain, so many people have gathered here deep in the mountains to blaze trails through the wilderness. We are here to plant the seeds of Bodhi so that in the future we may harvest the fruit of Buddhahood.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      What is meant by “planting the seeds of Bodhi”? Upasaka Bill has named this place “Buddha Root Farm.” At Buddha Root Farm one should plant Bodhi seeds. First you plant a Bodhi seed, then you send down the Buddha Root, and in the future you will reap the Buddha fruit. So your coming here is an extremely important first step.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      Why do I say that it is important? Because if you recite the Buddha’s name you can end birth and death, and then, like the Buddha, you can teach and transform living beings. From limitless eons past till now, each one of us has been born and then died, has died and been born, passed through birth upon birth－death after death: Who knows how many times we’ve turned on the wheel? We have not yet encountered the Dharma-door of Buddha-recitation, and so we have not ended birth and death.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
	Now, having learned the method of Buddha-recitation, we can be reborn in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. This is extremely important! Buddha-recitation is a serious matter because it can cause all living beings to end birth and death, gain release from the revolving wheel, separate from suffering, and attain bliss. Since it is so important, all of us participating here should be sincere and recite with a true heart.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      There’s a way to determine if you are reciting with a true heart. If you are sincere, the mosquitoes will not bite you. If you are insincere, the mosquitoes will bite you. If you recite with a true heart, you won’t be bothered by the rain. No matter how it pours, it won’t dampen the mind which recites the Buddha’s name. Recite until the wind blows, but doesn’t touch you; the rain pours, but doesn’t fall on you.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      If your only thoughts are to chant the Buddha’s name, then it won’t rain. The weather will be fine, that’s certain. The mosquitoes won’t bite you and the rain won’t fall. These are some responses that come from sincere recitation of the Buddha’s name. If you are simply pretending, then it will rain, the mosquitoes will bite, and you’ll be miserable sitting there. If you recite well, however, even when the mosquitoes bite you’ll pay no attention to them, and so it will be as if they hadn’t bitten.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      You should think, “I will endure the pain of being bitten. My only thought is to recite the Buddha’s name. If the mosquitoes bite, I won’t even know it.” If you don’t feel the bugs bite and if you don’t know it’s raining, that’s being true-hearted. If your heart is sincere you will certainly have a special response. You may see Amitabha Buddha coming to rub you on the crown of your head or you may see him bathing you in light. Amitabha Buddha may appear and cover you with his sash. These are all responses:</p>                      
      <blockquote>                  
      <p class="commentary_eng" align="left">                       
      <i>His hand rubs my head,&nbsp;<br>                 
      His sash covers me…</i></p>                      
      </blockquote>                  
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      Amitabha Buddha may respond in these ways.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      So if you don’t fear that the mosquitoes will bite, if you are unmoved by the rain, and if you’re not afraid to walk the rugged path back and forth, then your heart is true. If your heart is true, even when mosquitoes bite, you won’t feel it. That’s why I say they won’t bite. They won’t bite because you won’t know that you have been bitten! If, as soon as a bug flies near you, you think, “Oh no! Here comes a mosquito!” and try to brush it away, then you’ve forgotten about reciting.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      This is not a joke. It’s a very serious matter. When Guo Yu said to me today that a mosquito had bitten him, I said, “You haven’t been mindful and that’s why the mosquito bit you.” The mosquitoes are just acting on the principle that&nbsp;</p>

      If you can’t even deal with the demonic obstacle of a mosquito, then you’ve really chanted the Buddha’s name in vain.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      That’s all for today. I hope you all sleep well, and the mosquitoes don’t bite. If you recite as if you were asleep, then if the mosquitoes bite, you won’t know it. When you’re asleep you don’t feel them bite; if you recite well, it’s the same way.<a name="0818"></a></p>

      You should be aware that from limitless eons ago, from the time when you first became a human being until the present, your incarnations are uncountable. You yourself may not even believe that you have past, present and future lives. In each life you were confused, muddled, and unclear, and therefore, at present, you don’t know how much bad karma you have amassed as a human being. There is reason to fear that the bad deeds you have committed in one single life exceed the number of sand grains in the Ganges. Although reciting the Buddha’s name will eradicate offense-karma like the Ganges’ sands, you don’t know how much of it exists.                  
      Fortunately, our bad deeds have no material form. If they did, each individual’s karma would completely fill empty space. That’s the extent of your offenses! But, because karma has no material form, empty space has yet to be filled. So it says,</p>

      Here we are bivouacked out-of-doors under the open sky, camping in the wilds and reciting the Buddha’s name. There is nothing to shelter us from the rain. When it’s not raining we recite while walking on a circular track. This is truly an excellent recreation. We’re not here to play ball or set off rockets, but to recite the Buddha’s name. This is truly a subtle, wonderful, and inconceivable environment. There are no sounds at all. It’s not like San Francisco with its cars, buses, trolleys, and planes going “vroooom! Vroooom!” --- all making a tremendous din. It’s very peaceful here, and perfect for Buddha Recitation. So all of you take care not to waste this precious time.</p>

      Deep in the mountains the air is fresh and there is not the slightest trace of pollution. The evil world of the five turbidities, the turbidity of the eon, the turbidity of views, the turbidity of living beings, the turbidity of afflictions, and the turbidity of the lifespan---exists in places crowded with people. This wilderness, by contrast, is the clear, pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. If you can cultivate in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, the power of the noisy bustle of the city.

  “Namo Amitabha” is Sanskrit. Yesterday Guo Zhen said it was Chinese, but that’s completely wrong. “Buddha” is also Sanskrit. The Chinese character “Fo” is a partial transliteration of the word “Buddha.” Amitabha’s other name, “Amitayus,” means “limitless life.” When you recite the Buddha’s name, you obtain a limitless life span. Because you return your life and respectfully submit to the Buddha of Limitless Life, you may take the merit and virtue you obtain by reciting and live as long as you please!</p>

      You can do that, too. All you need to do is recite the Buddha’s name sincerely. This includes all of us gathered here today.

      The Buddha is not any bigger than we people are. Rather, he is just the same size. However, he has become enlightened and returned to his inherent wisdom. We are no smaller than the Buddha, and the Buddha is no smaller than we are.

      To become enlightened is to become a Buddha. Before enlightenment, one is just a living being. When you become enlightened you gain nothing that the living being doesn’t have. When confused, one hasn’t anything less than the Buddha has. There is no increasing and no decreasing; it’s a question of whether you are confused or enlightened. That’s where the difference lies.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      I will illustrate this with a very simple analogy. Mind you, this is just an analogy. Don’t take it literally, because it’s all hypothetical. The Buddha is like a university professor---university professors are not Buddhas---you should be clear about that point---and living beings are like students. Every student can become a professor. Every professor can become a student. The Buddha is, however, wiser than professors. He’s even highter than a professor! Remember, this is a mere analogy which demonstrates that the Buddha and people are the same.</p>

      “Then why should I chant the Buddha’s name? Why doesn’t the Buddha recite my name?” you wonder. “Why should I recite ‘Namo Amitabha Buddha’? Why doesn’t the Buddha recite me? Why doesn’t he recite my name?’”</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      That’s a good question. In fact, it’s got me stumped. I don’t know how to answer it, but I’ll think up something: Ah! I know! It’s because you never made a vow to cause living beings to recite your name. The Buddha Amitabha on the causal ground was a Bhikshu named Dharma Treasury, and he made forty-eight great vows. In every vow he said, “In the future, when my cultivation succeeds and I have become a Buddha, my country will be one of ultimate bliss and purity. The murkiness of the five turbidities will not exist within it. All living beings in the ten directions who recite my name will be led to rebirth in my land, where they may realize Buddhahood. As long as one of them has not become a Buddha, I will not accomplish the right enlightenment.”</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      Because of the power of the vows of Amitabha Buddha, we have gathered here to recite---with different          
      mouths but with the same sound---“Namo Amitabha Buddha.” We are cultivating by relying on the power of the vows of          
      Amitabha Buddha. When we recite the Buddha’s name, Amitabha Buddha knows about it. “Hey, I signed a contract with that living being saying that if he kept my name in mind I would lead him to become a Buddha. If I don’t guide him to Buddhahood now, the contract is nothing but a lie.” And the Buddha hurries right over to guide you to Buddhahood.</p>

      Don’t worry about that. You can arrive in a single thought. You don’t have to buy any tickets at all. In a single thought you can be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands are not beyond that one single thought.</p>

      Previously, the Buddha was the same as every other living being. Not only was he the same as human beings, he was the same as all living creatures, even mosquitoes, bees, and ants. Because he shared this kinship he later brought forth the thought of enlightenment. Having brought forth the thought of enlightenment, he practiced the Bodhisattva Way, benefiting himself and benefiting others, enlightening himself and enlightening others, helping himself and helping others, saving himself and saving others. There was no selfishness in the things he did; he was open and unselfish. He helped everyone.

 The Buddha saw a tiger about to starve to death, and he offered his body to the tiger as food.

Think it over: The tiger is the most ferocious of beasts and the hawk is one of the fiercest of birds, but when the Buddha saw that these evil creatures were starving, he gave up his life to save them.

Never can you occupy my position.”</p>

      Religion such as this is dictatorial, authoritarian, and unjust! On the other hand, everyone can become a Buddha. This is why Buddhism is the most democratic religion, the most just religion. The Buddha is completely devoid of selfishness, thoroughly devoid of desire for self-benefit. He is open, generous, and impartial, straightforward, true, and unprejudiced. He sees all beings as identical with himself and so he wants to take them all across.</p>

      Hearing this, someone has become arrogant. Why? It doesn’t occur to him that the Buddha became a Buddha by virtue of his cultivation. He says, “Oh, everyone is a Buddha. I don’t have to cultivate. I am a Buddha! Everybody is a Buddha!”&nbsp;</p>

  This person has deviant understanding and heterodox views. It’s true that everyone can become a Buddha, but in order to do so, one must cultivate. When you become enlightened you can certify to the result of Buddhahood. If you do not cultivate and have not become enlightened, what kind of a Buddha are you? You are a stupid Buddha, a confused Buddha. Muddled and dense, you understand nothing. You hear others talk about it, misunderstanding them, yet consider yourself a Buddha, too. This is not permissible.</p>

      We will now discuss the Pure Land Dharma-door, Buddha Recitation. The Pure Land is the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss, the country of Amitabha Buddha. When the Buddha was in the world, no one understood the Pure Land Dharma-door. That is why not even one of the Buddha’s disciples, with their great wisdom, didn’t understand it. No one thought of asking for it, and so the Amitabha Sutra, which we just recited, was spoken by the Buddha without request. All the other Sutras which the Buddha spoke were requested by an interlocutor.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 For example, in the Vajra Sutra the interlocutor was Subhuti, who asked the Buddha to speak the Sutra. Since none of the Buddha’s disciples understood this Dharma-door of Pure Land recitation---not even the great and wise Shariputra---the Buddha spoke the Amitabha Sutra to Shariputra without waiting to be asked. It is an extremely important Sutra and takes across those of great wisdom. Those who lack wisdom are not able to understand it. That we now have met to cultivate this method of Buddha Recitation makes Shakyamuni Buddha very happy and pleases Amitabha Buddha a great deal, too.

 Among the eighty-one grades, how big is the largest lotus? It’s about one hundred times as big as the United States of America. A small lotus is about the size of this country. This should give you a general idea. The bigger your lotus is, the bigger your Dharmabody will be when you realize Buddhahood and sit upon the lotus throne. If your lotus is the size of single U.S.A., then as a Buddha you will also be just about that big. The Buddha’s transformation bodies are inconceivable.

 As we sit here listening to the lecture, several mosquitoes among us are thinking, “Oh! How can the Buddha be that big? I don’t believe it.” It’s fitting that they don’t believe it, because they are so small they can’t believe there could be something that big. Not only do they not believe that the Buddha is as big as he is, they also don’t believe people are as big as they are. Although they may see a person, they don’t know what a person is. They think we are Mount Sumerus. Each one of us is, in fact, a Mount Sumeru. What does that mean? Today I’ll reveal this most subtle and wonderful dharma: Your Mount Sumeru is just your arrogance, your smugness, and your disbelief!

 Today is the second day of the Buddha Recitation Session. Yesterday you didn’t know what the recitation of “Namo Amitabha Buddha” was all about, and so I explained it to you. By now, each of you should know how to apply effort in reciting the Buddha’s name. When reciting,                 
 don't sing too loudly or it may injure your energies. However, if you recite too quietly, it’s easy to doze off and lose your vitality. Whey you are drowsy, you are not able to hear yourself recite. If you can’t hear yourself recite, then “Namo Amitabha Buddha” will not be present in your heart. So it is necessary to recite out loud so that your ears hear the sound clearly and distinctly, and your mind contemplates the sound clearly and distinctly. Don’t waste even a single second. At all times be mindful of your Buddha Recitation. Say “Namo Amitabha Buddha” with                 
 sincerity and concentration.

 Your mindfulness should be uninterrupted. Continue reciting at all times without a break. Last night I explained the first of the four techniques of recitation, “contemplating by thought.” Today I will continue with the second, “contemplating of an image Buddha Recitation.”

 When you contemplate using thought, Amitabha Buddha’s Dharma body is so large that it is not easy to expand the measure of your mind to contemplate it. As an alternative, you may set up an image of Amitabha Buddha and practice mindfulness of the Buddha while facing the image. Look closely at the white hair-mark between the Buddha’s eyebrows. The white hair-mark will emit a great light which will travel to the end of space throughout the Dharma Realm, so that all places receive the illumination. Within Amitabha Buddha’s light appear limitless Buddhas and countless Bodhisattvas. This is the method called “contemplation of an image Buddha Recitation.”

      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 The third is “holding the name Buddha Recitation” in which one repeats the six-syllable vast name, “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo,” that is, “Namo Amitabha Buddha.” This technique is divided into audible recitation and soundless recitation. Here in the Dharma assembly we practice audible recitation. When the bell is rung, everyone recites “Namo Amitabha Buddha” in unison, making a melodious sound.                 
 Soundless recitation refers to the period when we sit in silence while                 
 single-mindedly reciting “Namo Amitabha Buddha.” This is called “silent recitation,” or “vajra recitation.”

 Living beings are of three dispositions: a superior disposition, that is, people with wisdom; a mediocre disposition, that is, people of average intelligence; and an inferior disposition, that is, people who are very stupid. This method benefits both the young and the old, and works for both the intelligent and the dull. Intelligent people are those with wisdom and dull people are the stupid ones. People with wisdom who recite the Buddha’s name can easily gain a response. People who are stupid who recite will also find it easy to gain a response. Therefore the recitation of “Namo Amitabha Buddha” on the one hand saves effort and on the other costs nothing. It’s the most convenient Dharma-door of all. Not only is it convenient, it is the most expedient of all expedient methods, the shortest of all short cuts, the most wonderful of all Dharma-doors. Some people may say, “What’s the significance of the phrase “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo?” Its significance is profound and vast. Its wonder cannot be exhausted in speech, nor can its advantages.

 When the Buddha dwelt in the world, that era was called the Proper Dharma Age. At that time, the Buddha taught the Dharma and there were certified Arhats and great Bodhisattvas; the sages were dwelling in the world. The Dharma-image Age followed next, after the Buddha entered Nirvana. During this period people who cultivated the Way were few; those who were attached to external appearances and concentrated on making Buddhist images were many, but genuine cultivators were few in number.

 After the Dharma-image Age, came the Dharma-ending Age. The Proper Dharma Age lasted for one thousand years. The Dharma-image Age lasted another one thousand years. That’s two thousand years in all. The Dharma-ending Age endures for ten thousand years. We are now living in the Dharma-ending Age. What does the phrase “Dharma-ending” mean? It means that the Dharma has nearly come to an end and is about to disappear. The “disappearance” of the Buddhadharma involves the disappearance of belief in the Buddha. In the Dharma-ending Age, living beings’ faith in the Buddha is not firm. When the Buddha dwelt in the world, people’s faith was so firm that if you held a person at knife-point and threatened his life saying, “Don’t believe in the Buddha or I’ll murder you,” he would rather die than surrender his belief. That’s how solid in faith the people were during the Proper Dharma Age.

 Now, in the Dharma-ending Age, you don’t even have to threaten a person with death. You just have to say, “Don’t believe in the Buddha,” and they quickly reply, “Okay, fine.” You don’t have to threaten them, just tell them to quit believing and they will. It’s very difficult to promote faith.

 Calculate it for yourself: How many people are there in the world? Among the entire human race, how many people believe in the Buddha? You can lecture the Sutras to these believers every day and they will still waver between doubt and faith. You can conduct a small experiment. Try this. Invite a person out to a movie. He’ll accept on the spot and away you go. Then try asking him to a Sutra lecture. He will say, “Ohhh…sitting there for two hours is nothing but suffering and tedium. It’s not half as much fun as a movie!”

 That’s the Dharma-ending age for you. You needn’t threaten them with death. You can simply say, “If you believe in the Buddha, I’ll bow to you three times.” And what do you think happens? They snap, “You go believe in the Buddha yourself. Why bow to me?” In the Dharma-ending Age it is difficult to believe in the Buddha. People may believe for a while but then they retreat. They may believe for two and a half days, but before the third day rolls around, they turn back and say, “I’m tired of Buddhism.” Tired. See? That’s the basic make-up of people in the Dharma-ending Age. You suggest to him gently or tell him, directly, “Don’t talk so much!” and he’ll continue to talk, talk, talk too much! That’s the way it is. If you tell them not to do something, they insist on doing it. If you tell them to do something, they will insist on not doing it. That’s the way beings are in the Dharma-ending Age.

 In this age, the Dharma will disappear. The first Sutra to disappear will be the Shurangama Sutra. That is why those who study the                
 Buddhadharma should first investigate the Shurangama Sutra. As long as someone understand this Sutra, the Buddhadharma will not become extinct. As long as there is someone who can recite the Shurangama Mantra, the demon kings, the heavenly demons and those of externalist teachings will not dare come into the world to play their tricks and to make trouble. The Shurangama Mantra is the most miraculous mantra for helping the world. The Shurangama Sutra is the primary Sutra which protects and supports the Proper Dharma.

 The Shurangama Sutra will disappear first, and then no one will be able to recite the Shurangama Mantra, because it is too long. For example, many among us have been studying it for over a year and still can’t recite it. Basically, the Shurangama Mantra should take six months to learn. The Sanskrit “Shurangama” is transliterated into Chinese as          
 <i> leng-yan</i>, and those who study it are said to be “<i>leng</i>,” that is, in a daze, for half a year while memorizing it. Here in the West, we have people who have been          
 “<i>leng</i>” for one, two, and even three years, and still have not come out of their “daze.”

After one hundred years the six-syllable vast name will lose two syllables and only “A-mi-to-fo” will remain for another hundred years and then they will disappear. At that time people will be undergoing extreme suffering. They will have no blessings at all. What they eat will be like horse manure. The food will have no nutritive value, even the natural foods. No mater what one eats, it will be harder to swallow than horse manure. Why? Because the people will have no blessings. When the Buddha was in the world the water that people drank was more nourishing than the milk we have today. Why does today’s water lack nutritive properties? It’s because now the people don’t have such great blessings.

 At that time, people will be as tall as dogs. When their suffering reaches its peak, things will start getting better, and the eon will beg to “wax.” We are presently in an eon of “waning.” This means that every one hundred years the average lifespan of human beings decreases by one year and their average height by one inch. When it has decreased to the point that an average lifespan is ten years, and an average height is about the size of our present-day dogs, people will have sexual desire as soon as they are born and they will also be able to commit murder. That’s how rotten they will be.&nbsp;

 But at that time, the eon will being to wax, and every hundred years people’s lifespans will increase by one year and their height will increase by one inch. When the average lifespan has reached eighty-four thousand years---would you call that a long life?---it will begin to decrease once again. When the average lifespan has waned to eighty thousand years, the next Buddha, the Venerable Maitreya, will appear in the world. Whoever wants to meet him at that time should work hard right now.

 We are now conducting a Buddha Recitation Session. The Dharma-door of chanting “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo” is not easy to encounter. It is said:

 <b>Supreme, profound, wondrous Dharma:</b>&nbsp; It may look to you like Buddha Recitation is very easy, yet this method is quite rare and hard to find. You should all think about it: In America Alone, how many people understand the Dharma-door of Buddha Recitation? Many people will say, “Buddhists sit in Zen meditation.” Others say, “Cultivate the Secret School. It’s fantastic. It’s a secret.” Very few truly understand how to recite the Buddha’s name. In America such a Dharma assembly has simply never been held before.&nbsp;

 This is the very first time that the deep, deep, and wonderful Dharma has been explained in the countryside. You might say our Dharma assembly is unprecedented in the history of this country. And what is more, people have come from the four quarters to attend, including such distant places as Los Angeles and San Francisco. This demonstrates real sincerity. If they were not sincere, they would not have come all this way. They’d be at the movies instead, or out dancing, drinking, playing cards, shooting a few holes of golf, playing football, ice-skating, skiing, or whatever. However, these people have abandoned such pleasant diversions to chant “Amitabha” in the mountains.

 You are all sincere and today I am very happy. Why? Because you have evoked a response and stopped the rain. It didn’t rain last night and it didn’t rain today. That’s two days. This proves that you are earnest in your recitation. If it rains tomorrow, you’ve retreated. But if it doesn’t, then you will have created three dry days. If it doesn’t rain for a whole week, that will be conclusive evidence of genuine effort on your part.&nbsp;

 Since you are all so earnest, I will tell you what I’ve been doing. In the last few days I have negotiated and signed a contract with the mosquitoes. It says,

 Mosquitoes are not allowed to bite participants in the recitation session. Should they feel&nbsp;compelled to bite someone, they shall bite me first. This applies equally to all those&nbsp;attending, regardless of whether or not they are my disciples. Mosquitoes are not&nbsp;allowed to make trouble for anyone.

      <p class="commentary_eng">                     
 So they will bite me first because it doesn’t matter if the mosquitoes drink a little of my blood; I want to give it away. After this, if anyone is bitten by a mosquito, please report it to me. If bitten by one mosquito, tell me. If two bite you, announce, “I’ve been bitten twice!” and I’ll take it up with them. After all, they did sign a contract and if they don’t live up to it, I just might take them to court!

      The second day of the session has almost passed. I believe it won’t rain tonight. That means that during the last two days everyone has been sincere. I don’t know if you will continue to be sincere tomorrow. We’ll just have to wait and see whether it rains. While walking and reciting “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo,” when you hear the large bell, that is the sign that you are to return to your bowing cushions, and the tempo of the recitation is speeded up. I’ve noticed that many of you are unaware of this. When you recite, keep your hands in front of your chest; this is called the “palms-lowered position.” Don’t let your hands hang down by your belly. That does not look nice. They should be right in front of your rib cage, directly below the heart.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 When you hear the big bell, raise your palms and join them together. Then you no longer recite “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo,” but just “A-mi-to-fo.” I’ve noticed a lot of you don’t raised your palms at this time, but let your hands hang down or swing at your sides. This is because you don’t know about the rules. Although rules are not important, you still have to abide by them. As it is said, “If you don’t follow the rules [in Chinese the word for “rules” is made of the two words “compass and T-square] you can’t make circles or squares.” That is, if you don’t follow the rules you won’t attain your goal.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      For example, when Guo Tong came to the temple at the age of four, the only question he had was, “Why do there have to be rules?” That was the question he asked at age four. Seeing that he had this question at such a young age, I knew that he was an unruly kid.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      I told him, “The rules are there just because you don’t follow them. If you abided by the rules, there wouldn’t be any need for them.” Even now, I think he must still detest the rules. He wants to be free to run around, play, and be rowdy. That’s just his character. He’s like a monkey, jumping and crawling all over the place. He is very lively and his eyes are always looking around at everything. But he can really tell stories. If he continues, in the future, he’s going to make his mark as a master storyteller. He is only eleven now and he can really make stories up; wait till he grows up—he will be even better at it then. So keep your eye on him. Pretty soon his stories will fly right up into the sky.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      If anybody here wants a story, he can make one up for you. Don’t forget about that story about a single strand of hair [given in the               
      <i> The Earth Store Sutra </i> with the Venerable Master Hua’s commentary, published by D.R.B.A.]. that’s a secret dharma that most people don’t know about. Even if people want to know about it, don’t tell them right now.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      Also, when you stand at your places, those who come first should stand up in front and those who follow should stand behind them in the order that they file in. The first to come should not stand in the back so that those who follow have to shove past to find a place. No matter where you go, you should proceed according to the rules for order in the assembly. Then things won’t become confused, but will run smoothly. You should all take note of this.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
  Cultivation must be done every day. You can’t cultivate one day and slack off the next. The same applies to following the rules. You have to follow the rules every day. If you don’t, you are not acting in accordance with the precepts of the Buddhadharma. So, wherever you go, take care to observe the regulations and don’t be sloppy about it.</p>

      “Holding the name Buddha Recitation” can be practiced by both the young and old, and those in the prime of life. It is suitable for everyone. Sick people can recite the Buddha’s name. You who are sick suffer from the pains of disease because of karmic obstacles. You should hold the Buddha’s name in order to lessen these obstacles. Those who are healthy should take advantage of their health to recite the Buddha’s name and dedicate their recitation to insure their perpetual good health. Old people who are approaching the end of the road should follow the good path to the end. They should recite the Buddha’s name. Young people whose road ahead is filled with limitless light should recite “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo,” to make the light appear. Thus, the Dharma-door of Buddha Recitation is suitable for every type of person.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 You can chant while walking, standing, sitting, or reclining. However, when reclining you should not recite aloud. Do it silently in your heart. If you recite aloud it is disrespectful. The busiest people can recite the Buddha’s name, and people who are the most at leisure can also recite the Buddha’s name.</p>

      How do you practice recitation when you are very busy? You practice the               
      “<i>Morning and Evening Dharma of Ten Recitations.</i>” In the morning and the evening do “ten recitations.” Recite for the length of a single breath, “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo,” and that is one recitation. Ten such “breaths” is called “ten recitations.” In the morning when you get up, wash your face and brush your teeth. Then face the West, or better still face an image of Amitabha Buddha. If any of you would like to have an image, I have some paper images at Gold Mountain Monastery that I can give you. Face the Buddha image, join your palms together very respectfully and bow three times. Chant “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo” for the length of ten full breaths. Do this in the morning and in the evening. Recite “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo, Na-mo A-mi-to-fo, Na-mo A-mi-to-fo, Na-mo A-mi-to-fo…until you run out of breath and that counts as “one recitation.” Do this ten times in the morning and ten times in the evening.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 Don’t deliberately stretch out the length of your breath or cut it short. It should be very natural. This is called the “Morning and Evening Dharma of Ten Recitations.” Do this every day without interruption; it will only take five or ten minutes. Can you recite at other times during the day? Of course you can. The more you recite, the better. With the skill derived from your practice of this Dharma you can be reborn in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. This method of Buddha Recitation is the most convenient Dharma door.</p>

      As I said, “Those with wisdom should recite the Buddha’s name, stupid people should do it, too.” Suppose someone says, “I’m very stupid. Probably it’s useless for me to recite.” In using this technique, the more stupid you are, the better! The wiser you are, the better! No matter how wise you are you cannot exhaust the method of Buddha Recitation. No matter how stupid you are, you are still included within it and it can be your guide.</p>

      Among the Buddha’s disciples, one in particular was extremely stupid. How stupid was he? When you taught him how to recite “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo”---a mere six syllables---he could not remember them. Finally the Buddha thought of a plan.</p>

      “Fine,” he said, “since you can’t remember the Buddha’s name, I’ll give you two words. Just recite ‘sweep clean.’” But he still forgot! He would say “sweep” and forget “clean,” and then he would say, “clean…uhh…what was the first word again? Oh! Sweep! Sweep…sweep…Just a minute now; don’t tell me, ah…what was the second word?” He’d remember one and forget the other. He was that dumb. None of us here is quite that stupid. Even me. I’m a bit more intelligent than him. Don’t you think so? I do. You are all, of course, much more intelligent than I am. Anyway, what was his name? Little Roaside (Shuddhipanthaka). He got that name because he was born by the side of the road. Although he was very stupid, he later became enlightened when he found out—What did he find out?</p>

      He discovered that his mother was a woman! He didn’t know that before. The Buddha certified his enlightenment and he gained spiritual powers. See, if such a stupid person can get enlightened, we who are so intelligent will certainly have even more success. Okay, that’s all for today because someone is thinking the idle thought that, “You know, the lectures are really too long.”</p>

      <b>Bhikshuni Heng Hsien:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>              
      Today we’re in the third day of reciting the Buddha’s name, and you can expect to be getting a bit of response at this point in the session. Yesterday the Master talked about how people who were sick, if they recited the Buddha’s name, could be cured by virtue of their karmic obstacles being lessened through reciting “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo.” Yesterday we had a “big cat” story. Today I thought I’d tell a couple of “little dog” stories. These are true stories of how reciting the Buddha’s name has effected cures.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 The first involves a Pekinese dog who live in Fresno. Pekinese dogs were developed in China as a response to the introduction               
      of Buddhist Sutras. The very first printed books in China, printed from wood-block, were of the Vajra Sutra, and they depicted the Bodhisattva Manjushri riding on a lion. The ladies of the imperial court were very much taken by the lion, and so a new breed of dog was developed—the Pekinese—to look like the lion of the Bodhisattva Manjushri. So in Fresno, California, there was a small Pekinese—the runt of the litter. A runt, but a show dog. She wasn’t special dog, and a very lively, good-tempered dog, with only a few minor failings—a little bit of vanity and a little bit of               
      over-fastidiousness with regard to food, but aside from that, there seemed to be no reason that what happened to the dog should have happened, except perhaps it was due to the jealousy of one of the older, larger dogs.<br>               
      <br>               
  At any rate, when I went down to visit my great aunt, who owned the dog, the Pekinese was paralyzed from the waist down. Something had happened to her spine, and the whole back end of her. She couldn’t move, but she could drag it along just barely. She was in tremendous pain. You could see that she was exhausting her strength and was going to die very soon. I’d been studying the Buddhadharma for a while, and I had great faith in the power of the mantras and the power of the Buddha’s name. She was being taken for treatment with some kind of rays, but I saw that the people giving the treatment were more concerned with my great aunt’s pocket-book than they were with the dog. The treatments were not doing anything for the dog.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 I sat down with a book of the Shurangama Mantra and recited it two or three times, and then I started to recite the Buddha’s name, “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo.” It was very strange and very wonderful, but as soon as I started reciting it, it’s as if something clicked with the dog. I had her facing away from me, with the idea of concentrating on her injured spine, and she started looking around at me and               
      making all sorts of noises and gestures as if she wanted to recite the Buddha’s name too. And it occurred to me that perhaps—of course I had no way of knowing—but perhaps in previous lives this had been something that she was familiar with and that somehow struck a bell. At any rate, from that time on she improved. Within a few days, she was virtually normal with only a slight limp, and eventually she recovered entirely. This was by virtue of the recitation.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">                       
      Another incident involved people from Gold Mountain—Upasaka Guo Kui and Upasika Guo Cong. Before they had their daughter Guo Fang, they had a dog name Lucy. Lucy was a very lively and intelligent terrier. She had a lot of tricks and was very rambunctious—a very human kind of dog. I felt I had a lot of affinities with the dog. One afternoon I looked out the window of Gold Mountain Monastery to see Lucy being hit by a car. I went running out and found her lying in the street, severely injured. The car had probably hit her on the side of her head and the front part of her body. Her eyes were starting to roll back, blood was coming out of her mouth, her legs were sticking straight out and she was going stiff. The driver of the car, a demonic looking young man, came out and started yelling at her, “Hurry up and die, dog!”<br>               
      <br>               
  I asked him to leave, which he did, and started reciting the Great Compassion Mantra. Other people came out to recite, and someone went to tell the Master what had happened. Word came down to us that the dog was going to die, and we should recite, “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo.” We carefully moved the dog into the office, washed her wounds, wrapped her warmly in a blanket, and recited “Na-mo A-mi-to-fo” for all we were worth. We recited for a couple of hours, and during that time, you could see Lucy coming back to life. By the end of an hour and a half, you had to hold her down—she didn’t want to stay in the blanket. She’d been a dead dog out in the street, but she came back to life.&nbsp;</p>                     
      <p class="commentary_eng">                      
 We kept reciting until it was time for the Master to lecture. The Master immediately asked how Luc was and had us bring her upstairs. Now some people figure that Lucy had taken refuge at some point. Someone else saw her being ushered out of the Master’s quarters, presumably after an interview on another occasion. At any rate, she had a lot going for her in terms of studying the Buddhadharma. The Master               
      scolded her and reminded her that he had told her that if she kept running out of the building, she was due for some trouble. But she hadn’t listened, and that was why this happened. All of this she meekly accepted. She was already running around in a subdued fashion that evening, and she was normal by the next day—completely cured.</p>                      
      <p class="commentary_eng">An interesting thing about Lucy is that her owner, Upasika Guo Cong, was expecting Guo Fang at the time. Shortly before Guo Cong's daughter was born, Lucy just disappeared. She didn't get lost; nobody lost her. She                     
      just wasn't there anymore and very shortly after that Guo Fang was born.                     
      Now, don't draw any conclusions from that necessarily, because I've never                     
      seen Guo Fang pull that trick of sitting down on her haunches and playing                     
      around with her paws, so there may not be a connection. At any rate,                     
      that's the story of Lucy. Lucy isn't here today due to those causes and                     
      connection of the Buddha's name. The important thing in this, of course,                     
      is the power of not of one person but of lots of people.&nbsp;</p>                   
      <p class="commentary_eng"> When I was                     
      reciting for the other dog---Ah Choo was her name and she's actually very                     
      much alive at the present---I knew that it was the power of the Buddhas                     
      and Bodhisattvas that worked through the invocation of the mantra and the                     
      Buddha's name. People aren't always clear about this. However, it's easy                     
      when you have an extremely powerful mantra in your grasp to figure that                     
      it's you doing it and somehow get confused and maybe show off a little                     
      bit. This can be very dangerous.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">This happened to someone in China. There was a Bhikshu who had a lot of                     
      cultivation and he was known as the &quot;Living Arhat.&quot; His                     
      specialty was using the Great Compassion Mantra to cure people, and he                     
      could cure anybody of any disease. One time a lot of Dharma Masters were                     
      assembled at Pu-tuo-shan (<i>Pu-tuo</i> Mountain) in china for a precept ceremony. After the ceremony                     
      was over, many of them had no way to get back to their home temples.&nbsp;</p>                   
      <p class="commentary_eng"> The                     
      Living Arhat did a lot of flamboyant curing with the Great Compassion                     
      Mantra, amassed a lot of money, and rather conspicuously bought everybody                     
      tickets or chartered a boat to get everyone back to their temples. At that                     
      time the Master was part of the assembly and he saw that the Living Arhat                     
      was due to die pretty soon himself, so he went up to him and said,                     
      &quot;You're called the Living Arhat, aren't you? You can cure other                     
      people's illnesses, but have you cured your own?&quot;</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">&quot;What illness do I have?&quot; asked the Arhat.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">&quot;Now you've got the illness of seeking for fame, and in the                     
      future, you're going to contract the illness of seeking for profit. In                     
      fact, it won't be long before you fall,&quot; said the Master. Now the                     
      Arhat had some cultivation. He never lay down to sleep and ate only one                     
      meal a day, and he had this power, and he recognized that something was                     
      going on. But it was very strange: he immediately bowed down to the Master                     
      and pleaded with him, not to keep him from falling, but that when he did                     
      fall, to come and save him. So, since the Master grants people's wishes                     
      and the man was sincerely asking to be saved when he fell, the Master                     
      said, &quot;Alright, when you fall I'll save you.&quot;</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">Years passed, and Dharma Masters had to leave the mainland and flee to                     
      Hong Kong and Taiwan and so on. After a passage of time, what should                     
      happen but, on the streets of Hong Kong, the Master ran into the                     
      &quot;Living Arhat,&quot; except that he was no longer a Bhikshu. He was                     
      dressed as a layman. He had gone back to lay life; in other words, he had                     
      fallen. The Master said, &quot;Well, what happened to your Living                     
      Arhat?&quot;</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">The man said, &quot;It's just because everything you say is so                     
      effective. Your words are magical. It's just because you said I was going                     
      to fall that I've fallen.&quot;</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">The Master said, &quot;Well, I promised you that if you fell, I'd save                     
      you, so I'll save you. So you can go back to being a Bhikshu now.&quot;</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">&quot;Well, I haven't got any money,&quot; said the man. Now, in China,                     
      you had to pay a lot of money to leave home. If you wanted to leave home                     
      and you were broke, you were out of luck.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">The Master said, &quot;That's OK, I'll give you money and you can leave                     
      home.&quot; And so the man did. You would think the man learned his                     
      lesson, but he got involved with a layman in Hong Kong who was looking for                     
      a Bhikshu as a drawing card for his establishment. The layman at first                     
      approached our teacher, who would have no part in being used as an                     
      advertising gimmick. But this former Living Arhat took him up on the deal.                     
      So the layman set him up as a &quot;Living Buddha,&quot; bowing to him as                     
      such. It wasn't very long before the &quot;Living Arhat&quot; just                     
      disappeared. So it's very dangerous to play around with the mantras and                     
      the curing power behind them for one's own personal benefit.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">What is generally done in order to aid people is to transfer the merit                     
      from recitation of the mantras or recitation of the Buddha's name for                     
      other people's benefit. Transferring merit is one of the Ten Great Vows of                     
      the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, and these vows are recited every morning by                     
      people who do Morning Recitation.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">The first vow is to worship and respect all Buddhas. This is done by                     
      bowing to all the Buddhas, not just one Buddha. It certainly doesn't mean                     
      bowing to blocks of wood or pieces of stone that are carved to represent                     
      Buddhas. Rather, it means taking refuge with all the Buddhas of the ten                     
      directions and three periods of time.</p>                    
      <p class="commentary_eng">                   
      The second vow is to praise the Thus Come One’s qualities. Such praises                    
		are, for example, the praise of the Buddha Amitabha. The praise that                    
		says that Amitabha’s body is a golden hue and the light of his fine                    
		marks are beyond compare. The mark of the white hair tuft between his                    
		eyes is as large as five Mount Sumerus and his clear purple eyes are as                    
		vast as four great seas. In his light there are countless transformation                    
		Buddhas and boundless transformation Bodhisattvas. His forty-eight great                    
		vows save living beings and the nine grades of lotuses completely cross                    
		beings over to the other shore. This is a praise of the Buddha and that                    
		fulfills the second vow to praise the Thus come One’s qualities. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The third vow is to extensively cultivate the                    
		giving of offerings. Giving offerings can be done in many ways. It can                    
		be done by offering incense and flowers before Buddha images or it can                    
		be done with the offering of the pure heart which is not fixed at all. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The fourth vow is to repent and reform all                    
		karmic faults. This means repenting all the things you’ve done that make                    
		it hard for you to cultivate right now, that act as obstacles. Karmic                    
		obstacles make it hard for you to sit in quiet meditation; they make it                    
		hard for you to concentrate your mind on the Buddha’s name or whatever                    
		practice you are practicing. You repent of all the evil done through                    
		body, mouth, and mind through beginningless time up to the present.&nbsp; </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"> This                    
		is very important in taking refuge. There is a moment in the taking                    
		refuge ceremony when the aid of the Buddhas is invoked. At that point,                    
		the Buddhas of the ten directions shine light upon you, and if you can                    
		very sincerely repent at that moment, you can completely eradicate your                    
		karmic obstacles and be completely pure. It all depends on the degree of                    
		your sincerity at that time. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The fifth vow is to compliantly rejoice in                    
		merit and virtue, which sounds sort of occult and mysterious, especially                    
		about 4:30 in the morning when we recite the vow. But this means that                    
		whenever anybody is doing something that is good, you are pleased and                    
		you also participate; you join in. If people are having a recitation                    
		session, you don’t just say, “Well, that’s really fine that they’re                    
		having a recitation session.” You also go and participate. Some people                    
		heard from as far away as Los Angeles that there was this session of                    
		reciting the Buddha’s name up here in Oregon. They not only approved,                    
		but rejoiced or followed in accord and came up to participate. Other                    
		people have also come from a great distances. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The sixth great vow of Samantabhadra                    
		Bodhisattva is to request the turning of the Dharma Wheel. Now we know                    
		that the explanation of the Pure Land Dharma door was spoken by the                    
		Buddha without anybody explicitly requesting it. But in general, the                    
		Dharma must be requested before it is spoken. Of course the speaking of                    
		Dharma can be a speaking that takes many forms; it’s not just                    
		necessarily in words. So the sixth great vow is to request that giving                    
		of Dharma, the turning of the Dharma Wheel. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The seventh vow is to request that the Buddhas                    
		dwell in the world. Now, of course, when Buddhas become Buddhas, they                    
		just enter Nirvana and don’t have to stay around in our suffering world.                    
		They’re not subject to any kind of suffering whatsoever. If living                    
		beings want them to stay around, however, they will. So the seventh is                    
		to request that the Buddhas stay in the world and teach living beings. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The eighth vow is to always follow the Buddhas                    
		in study, which means doing what the Buddha did. The Buddha, for                    
		example, gave his life to save a starving tiger. This vow involves doing                    
		this kind of practice. The Buddha also cut off his flesh to feed an                    
		eagle. That’s another example of what can be done to constantly follow                    
		the Buddha in study. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The ninth vow is to forever accord with living                    
		beings. This doesn’t mean that when living beings are doing things which                    
		are questionable you go ahead and do them, too, because you want to                    
		follow in accord. It means that whatever living beings like, you start                    
		from there in teaching them. Whatever they like to do is what you use as                    
		a basis for helping them to end birth and death, without imposing some                    
		exterior kind of structure or regulation on them. You start out from                    
		where they’re at. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">The tenth is to universally transfer all merit                    
		and virtue. That means that you take the merit and virtue of all of the                    
		practices that you do from knowing about the Buddhadharma and being able                    
		to cultivate according to it, and transfer it to other living beings,                    
		ideally to all living beings on a very vast scale so that all will                    
		accomplish Bodhi. Merit can also be transferred for individual needs or                    
		for healing purposes. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Those are the ten great vows of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. Now the living Arhat that was mentioned, of course, was no                    
		Arhat because a real Arhat has ended one of the two kinds of birth and                    
		death. There are two kinds of birth and death. One is being born in a                    
		body with a given life span which is more or less fixed, though not                    
		completely fixed. And the other is change birth and death which is the                    
		birth and death involved in the constant succession of thoughts: One                    
		thought being born and dying, the next thought being produced and then                    
		being destroyed, and so forth. Arhats have ended the first kind of birth                    
		and death. They are no longer subject to being born in a body with a                    
		given life span. But, of course, the so-called ‘Arhat’ in the story had                    
		not reached that point. He didn’t have control over his own birth and                    
		death and so when his offenses had accumulated to a certain point, he                    
		had to die. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Now I know that some people wonder why we’ve                    
		said that our Master does not concern himself particularly, in most                    
		cases, with individual cures. It’s because the Master is curing on a                    
		much larger scale. He’s giving people the medicine for curing birth and                    
		death; that is, if one follows those teachings that he teaches one can                    
		learn to have complete control over one’s own destiny and be able to                    
		teach other people to do the same as well. So it’s not just a matter of                    
		being cured of a given illness, but of completely being free of birth                    
		and death. </p>                   
      <p class="commentary_eng"><b>A man:<br>               
      </b>Oftentimes examples are used to illustrate things that happen on the                    
		mind ground that happen in the world of the relative. An example such as                    
		this occurred to me today. I used to live with a group of people on a                    
		beach on Maui, called McKenna Beach. We were all engaged in setting up a                    
		camp. Right smack-dab in the middle of the camp was a part of the                    
		foundation to an old army bunker of reinforced concrete that was about a                    
		foot thick, two feet high, and quite a few feet long. Anyway, it had to                    
		go. We were all busy setting up camp and none of us really wanted to                    
		face the task of getting that thing out of there. Nevertheless, it was                    
		right in the way of the camp and impractical to keep. So, we’re all busy                    
		setting up camp and one person would go over with a sledge hammer and                    
		hit it a few times, and the thing wouldn’t move. This went on throughout                    
		the course of the day. A person would get on it for five or ten minutes,                    
		get discouraged and bummed out about the thing, then go back to whatever                    
		they were doing. Basically no one wanted to get on this thing. I was                    
		avoiding it altogether. It just looked hopeless. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">An idea occurred to me about half way through                    
		the day that with anything in the world, if you hit hard enough and long                    
		enough in one spot, it will eventually break up. After I took a swim to                    
		refresh myself, I grabbed a sledge hammer and worked on that piece of                    
		concrete. I just kept hitting it in the same place---toward the middle                    
		and toward the bottom---for about two hours. Finally, the entire thing                    
		broke. A couple of us hauled it out in two long pieces and got it out of

		<p class="commentary_eng">This illustrates how one should cultivate on                    
		the mind ground. Often people will begin cultivating a Dharma door such                    
		as reciting mantras or perhaps a Bodhisattva’s name or a Buddha’s name                    
		like we’re doing now. The beginning is usually fine, but after one                    
		achieves a little bit of concentration, one’s karmic obstacles rise to                    
		the surface and the more one meditates or recites or whatever Dharma                    
		door it is, the longer the obstacle will stay up on the surface. Many                    
		people don’t understand what is actually happening and say, “Well,                    
		meditation is just an utter drag. I’m more bummed out now than a few                    
		years ago when I started,” and they quit. This is a very, very common                    
		tendency and a tactic that people use to avoid facing the deeper                    
		problems of life. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Basically when cultivating a Dharma Door, such                    
		as reciting the Buddha’s name for example, one recites and recites. At                    
		the beginning notices nothing. After a while one notices that                    
		attachments and false views come into view. These will take a very                    
		definite personalized form according to who the individual is and what                    
		his attachments and shortcomings are. After a long as definite, tangible                    
		forms, these attachments all merge together into a kind of a blob within                    
		oneself of misery and melancholy and total, utter blah. This actually                    
		shows a little bit of success. Then one meditating on it, and lo and                    
		behold, this blob starts producing light. This is when a state of                    
		equilibrium is achieved. It’s basically the same whether one is reciting                    
		a Buddha’s name or reciting a mantra. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">One takes a conscious thought, this thought of                    
		the Buddha, and uses it to overcome one’s unconscious thoughts or false                    
		thoughts. Normally one’s false thinking is most definitely strong, very                    
		strong, stronger than one’s conscious thoughts. When one’s conscious                    
		thought, one’s recitation becomes as strong as one’s unconscious                    
		thoughts or false thoughts, they start bouncing back off one another and                    
		this will produce light in the mind. The longer you can keep the                    
		conscious thought equal to the unconscious thoughts arising, the longer                    
		the light will actually appear. And eventually this light will destroy                    
		one’s attachments and obstacles. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Very often—I know I find myself doing it all                    
		the time and many of you may notice the workings of your mind while                    
		reciting and walking around outside and sitting in here—one tends to say                    
		to oneself, “Oh, I don’t care about that. I don’t think that is                    
		necessary or I don’t think this is necessary.” When this kind of                    
		thinking occurs, one should ask oneself, “If I don’t think this is                    
		really so, then who is it that does?” Look into this question and really                    
		contemplate it. “If I’m not really attached to such and such a thing,                    
		who is it that is? If I don’t think I’m doing this wrong, who is it that                    
		thinks I’m doing such and such wrong or incorrectly?” These are things                    
		that should be looked into in order for one to realize who one really                    
		is. It’s very important to recognize the fact that you may be wrong and                    
		everybody else may be right, and really acknowledge this fact. Otherwise                    
		if one can’t bring a change of attitude to one’s mind, even one’s own                    
		cultivation could be totally incorrect. Basically, even meditation is                    
		false. If one’s attitude isn’t correct toward meditation, meditation                    
		itself will become an obstacle. It is important to realize this, so one                    
		doesn’t spend years of cultivation in vain. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">This sort of reciting that we’re doing today                    
		here in the session is really fine, because sitting is fine and most                    
		people here have probably done quite a bit of sitting meditation, but I                    
		know I, myself, and a lot of my friends never practice walking                    
		meditation. Walking meditation is a really fine practice and should be                    
		introduced more because it’s very important for people to realize that                    
		one doesn’t have to be seated in order to mediate. In our daily                    
		activities there is ample opportunity to practice meditation, even for                    
		very busy people. There are always times when one is waiting in line or                    
		one has to just bide one’s time. One can take these opportunities to get                    
		in quite a few hours of meditation a day, even in the course of daily                    
		activities. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">In addition to meditation, to eliminate                    
		obstructions and whatnot and to help one to realize one’s fundamental                    
		nature, there’s the keeping of precepts. The Buddha instructed his                    
		left-home disciples that after he passed into Nirvana the monks should                    
		take the precepts as their teacher. Basically, a person who becomes a                    
		monk is not supposed to get involved with any meditation whatsoever                    
		before keeping the precepts for at least five years, and there is a very                    
		good reason for this.&nbsp; </p>                      
		<p class="commentary_eng"> To draw another analogy, it’s sort of like going                    
		along in an automobile and trying to stop the automobile by just turning                    
		off the motor and not even bothering to apply the brakes. Now, the car                    
		will eventually stop and if it does stop, it will take a lot longer and                    
		it will also be a lot easier to get going again with no brakes applied,                    
		a child could come along and push it. The same principle applies to                    
		keeping precepts. If one achieves success in meditation and one has held                    
		the precepts for a good length of time, his chances of falling into                    
		worldly ways are pretty slim. Suppose one runs across a beautiful woman                    
		or a nice beautiful bag of ganja (marijuana) or psilocybum (another                    
		drug) or whatever one may like. It’s highly unlikely that one will                    
		think, “Oh, that’s really great,” and get involved in it. On the other                    
		hand if one cultivates on one’s own and ignores precepts, one can very                    
		easily not only fall into one’s old attachments, but create very new                    
		ones that will emerge very strong and make it very difficult to                    
		cultivate.<a name="0820"></a> </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> At gold Mountain Monastery we                   
		study the entire spectrum of Buddhism. We do not subscribe to any one                   
		particular sect or school. We maintain no such divisions. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> I recall the Master once saying that                   
		we must cultivate our roots where we come from and we must cultivate the                   
		Dharma where it comes from. I’m very new and I don’t really understand                   
		very much, but I do grasp the idea of birth and death. I understand that                   
		when things die, new things are born. I would like the Master to expound                   
		upon that and tell us more about what the Dharma is and how we can learn                   
		to propagate it in the Dharma-ending Age. Like other living things, when                   
		the Dharma ends, does it then get reborn? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> The Dharma is a method---a method                   
		for cultivating the Way. After practicing for a time, people often feel                   
		that the Dharma is not as fresh and exciting as it was at first and they                   
		quit cultivating. Basically, there is no Dharma-ending Age and there is                   
		no Proper Dharma Age. The Dharma itself is unmoving. It is not                   
		inherently “proper” or “ending.” People, however, are sometimes diligent                   
		and vigorous and at other times they are lax and lazy. When people are                   
		vigorous, that’s the Proper Dharma Age. When people are lazy, it’s the                   
		Dharma-ending Age. The Buddha Recitation session we are conducting here                   
		is a vigorous one and it is the proper Dharma Age for us. After the                   
		session is over, if you don’t cultivate and aren’t vigorous, it will                   
		revert to the Dharma-ending Age. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Another student:</b> Could the Master please tell                   
		us more about the third eye? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> There are five eyes, not just                   
		three eyes. Where have you heard about three eyes? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> Yesterday, when the Master discussed Amitabha Buddha’s white hair-mark, I took that to be the third eye. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> That’s not the third eye. That’s                   
		just the white hair mark. The Buddha doesn’t have just three eyes. The                   
		Buddha has a hundred thousand billion, limitless, boundless eyes. If we                   
		living beings cultivate, we too can possess a measureless number of                   
		eyes. On the tip of every hair alone there is an infinite number of                   
		eyes. The third eye which non-Buddhist religions talk about is really                   
		nothing. They simply have no understanding of what the doctrines of                   
		Buddhism are all about. If you cultivate and become a Buddha you will                   
		have an uncountable number of eyes and an uncountable number of hands. Guanyin Bodhisattva is said to have “a thousand hands and a thousand                   
		eyes,” but not only has she a thousand eyes and hands, she has more than                   
		ten thousand. It cannot be known how many hands and eyes she has. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Has anyone been bitten by mosquitoes?                   
		Certainly a lot of people must have bites? </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> What about the contract? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> The mosquitoes are not                   
		trustworthy. They are bound to fail to observe the terms of the                   
		contract. There’s not the slightest doubt about it. They are just too                   
		small to pay attention to things like that. There are too many of them,                   
		besides. I can sign a contract with one of them, but another won’t keep                   
		the agreement, and will close in. They like their independence and are                   
		very democratic in spirit. They won’t put up with having people                   
		supervise them. If I sign a contract with one of them, another will say,                   
		“I didn’t sign nothin’. I’m not following no contract,” and so they                   
		bite. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Translator:</b> The Master only made out a

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> Hey, it wasn’t just one. It was a                   
		lot of them. But there were still a lot of them who didn’t sign. For                   
		example, in this country there are the Democrats and the Republicans. If                   
		I signed a contract with one of them, the other would say, “He didn’t                   
		sign. It’s none of our business.” Mosquitoes, too, have a lot of                   
		different parties and sects. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Mosquitoes have the Mosquito Party. Ants have                   
		ant parties and bees have bee parties. Each creature belongs to its own                   
		organization and faction. Only my Buddhism has no party, no school, and                   
		no sect; it is all-inclusive, complete Buddhism. The Buddhism I teach is                   
		not Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Burmese, Ceylonese, or Indian. The Buddhism                   
		I promote is world-Buddhism, universal Buddhism, the Buddhism of the                   
		entire Dharma Realm. The Buddhism I promote I don’t even call Buddhism;                   
		I call it “the teaching of people.” If you are a person, you should                   
		believe in Buddhism. This is because people can become Buddhas. Since                   
		all people can become Buddhas, we can call this teaching “the teaching                   
		of people.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">But “the teaching of people” is not an                   
		all-inclusive term, so we will give it yet another name, “the teaching                   
		of living beings.” All living beings are included within it. This                   
		includes the living beings who fly in the air, those who walk on the                   
		earth, and those who live in the waters, as well as all the plants and                   
		trees. All the trees have living beings inhabiting them. Living beings                   
		are born from a conflux of changing conditions. When the causes and                   
		conditions conjoin, living beings are born. So I advocate that Buddhism                   
		be renamed, “the teaching of people,” and that that name be further                   
		changed to “the teaching of living beings.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">What is more, “the teaching of living beings”                   
		can be renamed “the teaching of the mind.” Because all living beings                   
		have minds, they can all become Buddhas. Thus we call it “the teaching                   
		of the mind.” The mind, the Buddha, and living beings are three and yet                   
		are not different. They are one and the same. That take the Dharma Realm                   
		as my school; I take the Dharma Realm as my name. And I embrace the                   
		teaching of the Dharma Realm. So, in name, substance, school, function,                   
		and teaching, it is all “the Dharma Realm.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Name: The Dharma Realm. <br>

<p class="commentary_eng">The entire Dharma Realm is our scope. All                  
		living beings live within the Dharma Realm. No matter what religion you                  
		follow, you can’t go beyond the Dharma Realm. Moreover, there is no way                  
		you can deny that you are a living being. All living beings are included                  
		within the Dharma Realm. Thus you are encompassed within Buddhism.                  
		Whether you are a good person or a bad person, you are included within                  
		Buddhism, and I consider you to be a Buddhist whether you consider                  
		yourself to be one or not. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">You may say, “But I don’t believe in                   
		Buddhism.” Well, that’s your business. You are like a person who ran                   
		away from home at an early age and now no longer recognizes his own                   
		father. Even face-to-face you no longer know your father. The scope of                   
		my Buddhism includes everyone---believers and non-believers alike. Are                   
		believers real Buddhists and non-believers not Buddhists? No. Whether                   
		you believe or not, I claim you as a Buddhist. The Buddha himself said,                   
		“All living beings have the Buddha nature and all can become Buddhas.”                   
		You can’t run away. There’s no place to run to! So when my disciples                   
		want to draw near, they may do so; if they want to leave, they are free                   
		to leave. No matter where you go, I know you’ll never run beyond the

		If you believe, fine. If you don’t, that’s even better. If you praise                   
		Buddhism, fine. If you slander it, it doesn’t matter. I am vigorous                   
		whether the situation is favorable or unfavorable. Even if you slander                   
		Buddhism, I will still take you across to Buddhahood. For example,                   
		yesterday Guo Li said a mosquito was biting his ear and I told him to                   
		make a vow to cross it over to Buddhahood. When you have that kind of                   
		vow power, the mosquitoes won’t bite you. Guo Tong said that a mosquito                   
		had bitten him and I told him to take it to jail. He said, “No, no, no…”                   
		Even though he was bitten, he wouldn’t lock the bug up in jail. That’s

		<p class="commentary_eng">Even though I said that I had signed a                   
		contract with the mosquitoes, some people have been bitten by them.                   
		Although a contract was signed, in all matters one should reflect upon                   
		oneself, illuminate inwardly. The first doctrine I spoke was the real                   
		one. What was that? I said that if you brought forth your true hearts to                   
		recite the Buddha’s name, no mosquitoes would bite you and no contract                   
		would be necessary. If you do not recite sincerely, but drift off in                   
		idle daydreams instead, the mosquitoes know what to look for and they’ll                   
		say, “You! You’re supposed to be cultivating and reciting the Buddha’s                   
		name but all you’re doing is day-dreaming. Okay, you can just offer me a

		cultivating and reciting. No matter what, I’m not going to pester him.”                    
		Although mosquitoes are small, they can tell by looking, and they also                    
		know how to distinguish odors. If you have the “Buddha Recitation

		not true, if you’re like me, for example, and do nothing but                    
		day-dreaming, they come to beg from you all the time. The mosquitoes                    
		come to ask for a handout, and although I’m very stingy, I have to                    
		oblige and give them a little blood.&nbsp; </p>                  
      <p class="commentary_eng"> The same is true, of course, for

		order to help someone else, so the mosquitoes say, “This guy is a hard                    
		case. I have to transform him in a tough way instead of gently. He’s                    
		very stingy with his blood and so I’m determined to taste it.” They are                    
		encouraging you to bring forth the thought of Bodhi, because when they                    
		sting and drink a little blood you may wake up a little, “Ah, the Saha                    
		world is truly filled with suffering.” Because the bite hurts for                    
		several days, you can know how bitter samsaric existence is, and think,                    
		“I must hurry up and recite the Buddha’s name and seek rebirth in the                    
		Land of Ultimate Bliss where there is no suffering, only happiness.                    
		There are none of the three evil paths, and no mosquitoes, ants, or                    
		other pests there either.”&nbsp; </p>                  
      <p class="commentary_eng"> And if you do bring forth the thought of

		help you cultivate. You’ve got to turn the illumination around and                    
		reflect inwardly. Ask yourself, “Have I recited in earnest?” That’s the                    
		important point. Yesterday when I said that I had signed a contract,                    
		that was false. What I told you today is the truth. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Someone is thinking, “I came to this                    
		recitation session to hear instructional talks; why is he talking about                    
		mosquitoes?” Although the mosquitoes are small, they are a topic for a                    
		major essay. When we cultivate the Way, we should start from the small,                    
		not from the big. One proceeds from the small to the big, from the near                    
		to the far, from the lowly to the lofty. So if you can be clear about

		<p class="commentary_eng">If you don’t want to hear what I have to say,

		for three days, and that is a great response, but there are still four                    
		days left. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. Everyone should be                    
		mindful; be extremely earnest and sincere as you chant. Don’t be lazy                    
		and sneak off to rest, and don’t neglect to join the recitation. You’ve                    
		come from such a long distance; to be careless and flippant at this                    
		point would make the experience meaningless. So it doesn’t matter who                    
		you are, all participants in the Dharma assembly must endure the

		So much has been going on that trying to share with people the beauty                   
		and wonders of it is like trying to scoop the ocean out with a teacup.                   
		It’s really hard because you can only get a drop at a time. But the                   
		water that comes out is so nourishing, so fine, that it’s really worth                   
		all the effort. It’s kind of frustrating for people who have been                   
		cultivating a little longer to know how much there is and to want to                   
		share it all at once. Of course you can’t do it, but I think this week                   
		has been an epoch-making event. This is a historically significant                   
		occasion because it’s very similar to the Dharma assembly---this is an                   
		arrogant thing to say, but it seems to me Sixth Patriarch, the Great                   
		Master Hui Neng, spoke his Dharma Jewel Platform Sutra.. The conditions                   
		were somewhat similar, and certainly the quality of Dharma was of the                   
		same flavor. This is a remarkable event; don’t miss it. As the saying

		the Five Contemplations.” I imagine every one of you has said, “Okay,

		you should be mindful of the amount of work that it took to bring the                   
		food here to the place of eating.</b> Think about the farmer who grew the                   
		vegetarian meal that you’re eating, the various people that were                   
		involved in planting, nurturing, harvesting, trucking, sorting, selling,                   
		and preparing the food all to bring it into your mouth. There’s a lot of                   
		work involved, a lot of sweat and toil. You’re reaping the benefits from                   
		it, and you should be mindful of the amount of work that was required in                   
		all these different phases to bring the food to the place of eating. The

		of this offering of food?</b> That is to say, have you done anything today                   
		to deserve the blessing of eating? The Chinese talk about “mouth                   
		blessings” (</font>口福 <font face="Times New Roman"> kou fu) – the mouth gets a lot of blessings to enjoy.                    
		What have you done today to serve the Dharma? Have you served anyone                    
		else? Have you been a lazy worm? Have you been vigorous? Have you been                    
		mindful of the Buddha and really done the work out here? Have you been                    
		interested mainly in pursuing the five desires instead? These are                    
		questions that only you can answer. This is the second contemplation.

		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">3. <b> Guard your                    
		mind and depart from all transgressions, of which the most coarse is                    
		greed.</b> The foremost of the three poisons (greed, hatred, and stupidity)                    
		is greed. Now, who isn’t greedy? Who doesn’t have greedy thoughts? Well,                    
		the Buddha doesn’t have greedy thoughts. Sages don’t either. But almost                    
		everyone else, up to and including Seventh Stage Bodhisattvas, still                    
		have some slight flicker of desire, some slight stirring of the                    
		passions. Now, someone who is just beginning to cultivate the Way will                    
		think, “Gee, I’m doing pretty well. I don’t have any greed left. I was                    
		able to put down that fourth bowl of noodles today and share it with                    
		someone else.” Well, that’s good. That’s the first step. You start near                    
		if you want to go far. That’s the way to begin.&nbsp; </font></p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> But know that greed                    
		manifests in a thousand different ways, and once you get past the coarse

		powerful and poisonous. It all depends on the subtlety and quality of                    
		your mind as you cultivate.</font></p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">So the third                   
		contemplation is to guard the mind and depart from all transgressions,                   
		of which greed is by far the most prominent. Some people say that greed                   
		is the thing that turns the world. Well, if you can put your greed down,                   
		if you can actually get in there and uproot the greed and the mountain                   
		of self---that false illusion of a self that you’re getting something                   
		for---then you’re really cultivating the Way. That’s where cultivation                   
		actually works.&nbsp; </font></p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> People say, “My gosh, Buddhism? I know all about                   
		Buddhism. I’ve read all those books. I’ve seen those farout pictures of                   
		things popping out of these sages’ heads---they sit there all tranquil.                   
		I sat in meditation this morning and I know what Buddhism is all about.”                   
		Well, they’re not wrong. Buddhism includes all that. Buddhism includes                   
		just about every kind of practice and every kind of thought that you can                   
		imagine. But the Buddhism that’s taught at Gold Mountain starts with the                   
		very common, the very ordinary, mundane things of daily existence---for                   
		instance, eating. Wow, eating is the place where a lot of cultivation or                   
		lack of cultivation happens every single day.&nbsp; </font></p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> The Master urges his                   
		disciples to be mindful of their eating. He sets a perfect example by                   
		the vow he made, which was to strictly observe the Buddha’s regulation                   
		and take only one meal a day, and that being taken before noon. This is                   
		one of the Twelve Ascetic Practices that Shakyamuni Buddha and early                   
		Buddhists cultivated. It’s not to say at all that to be a Buddhist you                   
		can only eat once a day. For a lot of people that would be too much---it                   
		would turn them away from Buddhism. That’s not the way to go about it.                   
		The way to go about it is to be mindful of your eating, and be mindful                   
		of the greed that makes you want to eat more, and eat more, and eat                   
		more…&nbsp; </font></p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> Basically, Americans are pretty wasteful when it comes to eating.                   
		Americans eat much too much. They just pile it on when they don’t have                   
		to. That’s why we have so many heart attacks, so many arterial                   
		diseases---that sort of thing. It’s because people’s eating habits are                   
		pretty gross. So the third contemplation is to guard the mind and depart

		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">4. The fourth                   
		contemplation is that <b> food is medicine</b>. If you can really think that way                   
		and grasp that idea, you’ll never use more than you need to cure your                   
		disease of hunger. If you think about it, it is medicine. Everything                   
		that you put in your body is medicine of one kind or another. The Master                   
		has lectured time and time again: Don’t pay any attention to whether                   
		food is delicious or plain. That’s not the point. The point is to eat                   
		until you’re full, and then stop. People who stress the variety of                   
		flavors and the delicious quality and the perfect turning of a pot of                   
		rice or the expert seasoning of that salad dressing---that’s to be                   
		attached to food, and that’s to use up your blessings. People eat away                   
		their blessings.&nbsp;</font></p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> In fact, in the mind ground, where real cultivation                   
		takes place, you should pay no attention to whether food is delicious,                   
		or super-nutritious, whether it’s perfectly cooked or badly cooked. You                   
		should eat what comes in front of you, and eat until you’re eighty                   
		percent full---don’t stuff it right up to the top. Then you’ll see that                   
		food is really medicine. Now, you wouldn’t take nine aspirin to cure a                   
		headache any more than you would put a gun to your head and pull the                   
		trigger. That’s overkill. The same thing with food. Food is medicine,                   
		and if you see it as medicine you’ll never eat too much. You’ll eat just                   
		enough to cure your disease of hunger, and then you’ll stop.</font></p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">Now, this is not                   
		to say that you’re really virtuous if you eat less than the person                   
		sitting next to you. That’s not the point. Some people have a huge                   
		capacity. If they eat six bowls of rice and they’re not full, they                   
		should eat until they’re eighty percent full. Another person has a                   
		smaller capacity. If he ate three spoonfuls of rice and he could only                   
		hold one, then he’s being greedy. It’s entirely up to you. You eat your                   
		own food, just like you wear your own clothes. But you should know your                   
		own limits. </font></p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">5. The fifth                   
		contemplation is that <b>you should accept food only to cultivate and to                   
		accomplish the Way</b>. The only reason that you eat at all is to keep your                   
		body going so that you can continue to do the work with vigor and                   
		accomplish the Way. Basically, the body is impure. It’s got all kinds of                   
		impurities floating around inside; every hole puts out a different kind                   
		of foul stuff. When you die, this beautiful body that you’ve put                   
		deodorant on all these years to make it smell better, that you’ve                   
		brushed, combed, washed, patted, exercised, and taken care of in all                   
		these ways to keep the illusion going that it’s attractive and                   
		bearable---is revealed. At death, this fallacy really comes home and you                   
		can see this body for what it is---a stinking bag of skin. Inside are                   
		bones and they come popping through; and the worms eat it and it goes                   
		right back to the ground.&nbsp; </font></p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> While this body is impure, at the same time, a                   
		human body is the perfect vehicle to cultivate the Way. If you don’t                   
		eat, you’re going to die. So you eat just enough to cultivate and                   
		accomplish the Way. That’s the purpose of eating. </font></p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">There’s a verse                   
		that makes the <i> Five Contemplations</i> a little easier to remember. It goes                   
		like this:

		Of the poisons of the mind, the most despicable is greed. <br>                  
		As a medicine cures illness, I eat only what I need. <br>

		So I contemplate in silence on this offering today.</i> </font></p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman">The first line                   
		says, “This offering of the faithful is the fruit of work and care.” The                   
		whole matter of offerings is an important one in Buddhism. It’s very                   
		important in that it’s the first of the Six Perfections in Sanskrit, bu-shi (</font>布施<font face="Times New Roman">)           
        in Chinese. When a person leaves the home life, he takes a vow                    
		of poverty. One of the Shramanera (novitiate) precepts is that you own                    
		nothing valuable---money and so forth. Basically, Sanghans need nothing.                    
		They need the requisites of a roof, food, and clothes, but in minimal                    
		amounts. In India, monks went begging. Because in China the weather                    
		could go to extremes and it was really hard for monks to go out daily                    
		begging---often the monasteries were way out in the wilds and there were                    
		no communities to beg from---gradually the practice of begging was                    
		discontinued in China, and the monks relied for the sustenance on the                    
		offerings of the faithful. How can a monk say, “Gee, you ought to give                    
		to me”? Well, they don’t say that.&nbsp;

		<p class="commentary_eng"><font face="Times New Roman"> The major function of a left home

		it alive in the world. That’s how he serves the Triple Jewel. How does

		and cultivate this principle of Bodhisattvaship, which is helping                    
		himself and helping others. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">By making offerings to the Triple Jewel, you                    
		are doing real work for other people-you are planting seeds in the field                    
		of blessings that the Sangha represents. At the same time you are tying                    
		conditions with the Dharma so that in the future you can encounter the                    
		miraculous Dharma again and continue your cultivation towards Buddhahood.                    
		And you are also keeping this pure, ancient wisdom in the world a little                    
		longer by making these offerings. So it’s an important role and                    
		shouldn’t be taken lightly. Now in America where the Dharma is really                    
		young, the sprout is just out of the ground. It’s a sturdy sprout moving                    
		towards the sun, but it’s still a small one. People have to investigate                    
		how this relationship between the Triple Jewel, between the Sangha and                    
		the lay community operates. There is a proper way for it to work. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">For a Sanghan to accept any offering                    
		whatsoever is to put himself under a heavy karmic burden. When accepting                    
		an offering, the Sanghan says, “Well, I’ve got to get enlightened                    
		because I’ve accepted this. Otherwise, I’m making a karmic mistake.”                    
		Only an Arhat is really worthy of an offering. That’s one of the names                    
		of the Buddha-Worthy of Offerings. Once Sanghans accept an offering,                    
		they’re giving themselves a heavy mandate to cultivate to enlightenment.                    
		They should not miss that point.&nbsp; </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"> On the way to Buddhahood, the Buddha                    
		cultivated the Paramita or Perfection of Giving. He gave up his life,                    
		which you could say is a sincere offering. Time and time again, for the                    
		sake of the Dharma, for the sake of other living beings… The Master has                    
		said that to give up your life for the sake of the Dharma as many times                    
		as there are atoms in the universe. That’s taking a long view of                    
		history, but that’s the way it is. He gave up his life that many times.                    
		How much the more did he give up his external wealth-things like money,

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> When we are reciting the Buddha’s

		<p class="commentary_eng">This layman just said that many people in the                   
		world lack food, clothing, and shelter. Many people have no food to eat,                   
		no clothing to wear, and no house to live in. Why is this? It’s because                   
		those who do good are few and those who do evil are many. People who                   
		commit many evil acts and do not practice good deeds must undergo this                   
		kind of retribution. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">This kind of retribution is not easy to avert,                   
		since those who do evil are so numerous and those who do good are so                   
		few. If you want to make the world a good place, you must first begin                   
		with yourself. If you want to alleviate the sufferings of everyone in                   
		the world, you must also begin with yourself. How? Do no evil yourself;                   
		instead, practice all kinds of good deeds. In this way you can avert the                   
		disasters due to afflict us and help the world out a bit. Do as many                   
		good deeds as you have the power to do. Do your best to fulfill your                   
		responsibilities, but don’t worry too much. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">If you do nothing all day except sit and                   
		think, “People are suffering too much. What can I do?” it is useless.                   
		You yourself must do good deeds and make it so that there are more good                   
		people in the world every day and fewer bad people. Then the world will                   
		be well, and everyone will have clothing, food, and shelter. It is not a                   
		matter of saying, “Democracies are no good. We should become communists                   
		and share the wealth.” In communist countries, it’s not necessarily the                   
		case that everyone has food, clothing, and shelter. In fact, sometimes                   
		there is misery on top of misery. Therefore, if you wish the world to be                   
		good, you must refrain from all evil and practice all good, and then the                   
		world will naturally become good. It is said, </p>

		people took refuge, I asked, “Why did all of you decide to take refuge?”                   
		The new disciples had been followers of an outside-way teacher, whom I                   
		had given the name, “Shan Lu,” “Mountain Deer.” When I first came to San                   
		Francisco, Shan Lu wanted to come and study the Buddhadharma with me. At                   
		that time I only gave informal Dharma talks once a week, on Sundays. He                   
		came every Sunday for two years. His name was Mountain Deer. I gave him                   
		this name. His original name might have been “Wild Deer” but I called                   
		him “Mountain Deer.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why did so many people believe in him? Because                   
		during the two years he studied with me, he learned a few doctrines and                   
		set himself up as a patriarch, and took disciples. Why did his disciples                   
		believe in him? He had money, perhaps as much as a million. Whoever went                   
		to him and believed in him had food to eat, a place to live, and clothes                   
		to wear. They solved their problems of the three necessities. Thus, many                   
		people who had no food, clothing, or shelter came to believe in him. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">He was seventy or eighty years old and very                   
		rich, so he gained a large following. He was also very casual. You could                   
		eat meat and drink wine if you liked-he would buy you your wine and your                   
		meat!-in fact, you could have anything you wanted. There was no moral                   
		code at all. He didn’t talk about the moral precepts at all, yet he                   
		claimed to be an enlightened patriarch. A lot of people, as the word got                   
		around, said that he had attained sagehood and others said that he was                   
		enlightened. Some really stupid people studied the Buddhadharma with                   
		him, while others, the smart ones, thought continually about his money.                  
		</p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">He had one disciple who thought, “I’ve                   
		followed you for so long, and you still haven’t died and left your money                   
		to me! What a nuisance!” One day as the teacher was on the stairs, that                   
		disciple gave him a push and he went tumbling down the stairs and became                   
		unconscious. Taking advantage of the fact that the “enlightened                   
		patriarch” was in a coma and couldn’t talk, the disciple claimed that                   
		his teacher’s final instructions were to give the money to so-and-so,                   
		and that no one else had any share in it. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Then, without a sign, without a sound, the                   
		teacher died. After his death, the group published his books and styled                   
		him a patriarch. One night, he appeared to his followers in a dream. He                   
		said, “The Dharma I taught you in the past is not ultimate. You should                   
		now go take refuge with Dharma Master so-and-so, and study the                   
		Buddhadharma with him. That’s the right thing to do.” So his followers                   
		came to me and signed up to take refuge with the Triple Jewel and                   
		started studying the Buddhadharma over again. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">When you cultivate the Way, it’s not easy to

		and without any real understanding they proceed to teach other people.                   
		Shan Lu, for example, was such a one. Yet he still had a sense of                   
		conscience, for when he realized he had done wrong to his disciples, he                   
		told them to take refuge with the Triple Jewel and thereby avoid falling                   
		into the hells. That was pretty decent of him. And so many of his                   
		followers came to Gold Mountain Monastery to take refuge. Of the thirty                   
		people who took refuge that day, more than twenty of them were Shan Lu’s                   
		disciples. After the ceremony, they told me about this dream. They said                   
		that Shan Lu had instructed the entire group to come and take refuge.                   
		They believed their dream, because over twenty of them had dreamt the                   
		exact same dream. They thought it was a miracle. Do you all remember                   
		this incident? [Disciples: Yes.] And so all those people had that dream.

		<p class="commentary_eng">For example, cats eat mice. They say that in                   
		past lives they liked to kill and in their present life they still like                   
		to kill. Tigers are the same way. They proclaim their own wonderful                   
		Dharma, and if you understand that they are speaking the Dharma you will                   
		not imitate their conduct. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">How did dogs get to be dogs? Dogs are very                   
		stingy. They can’t give anything away, so they guard the door. When                   
		someone comes, they bark and bite. Why do they bite? It shows their                   
		stinginess. They don’t like strangers, so they bite because they are                   
		afraid someone will steal the valuables. You could say that they are                   
		“wealth-guarding slaves.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">There are people who share this attitude                   
		towards money. They can’t give up a single cent. When you tell them to                   
		give, they object violently. In China, many people keep their money for                   
		their sons and daughters. They turn into beasts of burden, scraping                   
		together a pittance to leave to their children. This is utterly foolish.                   
		A verse says, </p>

		distant time, I’ll shrink the time period so that you can understand.                    
		[The Master added the following during translation] Yesterday was just                    
		your former life and today is your present life. Tomorrow will be your

		that there was a yesterday, is a today, and will be a tomorrow. Can you                    
		seriously object to this? Yesterday, today, and tomorrow exist and in

		long ago. But because you’ve been muddled and confused through limitless                    
		eons until the present, you haven’t known your former or your future

		<p class="commentary_eng">When the Buddha was in the world, he once went                    
		to a layman’s house to accept offerings. In the house there was a dog                    
		that stayed under the bed, day and night. He wouldn’t allow anyone                    
		except members of the family to get near the bed. Anyone else who                    
		approached got bitten. Even the Buddha was not allowed near the bed. The                    
		household experimented to see if the dog would bite the Buddha, and,                    
		sure enough, it snapped at him. They asked the Buddha why the dog was so                    
		protective of the bed.&nbsp; </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"> The Buddha said, “Don’t you know? In its last                    
		life the dog was your father. Your father spent his whole life earning                    
		about three hundred ounces of gold and loved it so much he buried it                    
		under the bed. Then suddenly he got sick and died before he could tell                    
		you what he had done with it. After his death he hurried right back as a                    
		dog to guard the pile of gold. If you don’t believe me, start digging                    
		and you’ll find the gold.” They dragged the dog away and did, in fact,                    
		uncover three hundred ounces of gold. This proves that stingy people can                    
		easily turn into dogs. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Dogs are speaking the dog-dharma. Cats relate                    
		the cat-dharma. People expound the people-dharma. In the world,                    
		everything speaks the dharma it wants to speak. The important point is                    
		whether you understand it or not. If you understand it, the dharma is                    
		spoken so you may understand more. If you don’t understand it, you’re

		What does this mean? Why do people have eyes? It’s because in the past                    
		they refrained from doing much evil. Why does someone else lack eyes?

		business. They wanted to hear everything so they listened in on                    
		conversations, phone calls, and so forth, and thus they became deaf. Why                    
		are mutes mute? Because they indulged in gossip. Before long, they

		<p class="subtitle2_eng">Friday, August 22, 1975 (afternoon)<p class="commentary_eng">                  
		So far, I have explained three techniques of Buddha Recitation:                   
		“contemplation by thought,” “contemplation of an image,” and “holding                   
		the name.” But I have not yet explained the fourth method, which is                   
		“Real Mark Buddha Recitation.” The Real Mark is apart from marks; it is                   
		not attached to any distinguishing characteristics. It has left all                   
		dharmas behind and swept away all marks. This is the Dharma door of                   
		investigating dhyana. Those who truly practice dhyana truly chant the                   
		Buddha’s name as well. Those who can really recite the Buddha’s name                   
		are, in fact, investigating dhyana. Dhyana practice and Buddha                   
		Recitation both help you to stop your idle thoughts and sweep away your                   
		personal desires and random thoughts, so that your original face                   
		appears. This is called Real Mark recitation. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">The Buddha spoke all the Dharma doors to cure                   
		the illnesses of living beings. If living beings had no illnesses, then                   
		none of the methods would be of use. But, because we living beings have                   
		such problems, the methods are useful. Of the eighty-four thousand                   
		Dharma doors spoken by the Buddha, every Dharma door is number one. Not                   
		one of them is number two. Whichever method is appropriate to your                   
		situation is number one. If one is inappropriate and you can’t use it,                   
		that doesn’t mean that it is number two, because it may be number one                   
		for someone else. So I say that there are eighty-four thousand Dharma                   
		doors and eighty-four thousand of them are number one. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Now we are cultivating the method of Buddha                   
		recitation, and some also cultivate the technique of holding mantras.                   
		There are various mantras, and there are many different Buddhas, but of                   
		all the Buddhas, Amitabha Buddha has the closest affinity with us. We                   
		living beings may be likened to iron filings and Amitabha Buddha is like                   
		a magnet which draws us in to the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. The                   
		other Buddhas are also like magnets, but their magnetism is not as                   
		strong. So living beings should recite the name of Amitabha Buddha and                   
		cultivate the Pure Land Dharma door. This is the first time in the                   
		history of America that we have gathered in the mountains to recite the                   
		Buddha’s name. I believe that we are planting a cause which will in the                   
		future certainly produce a grand blossom and bear a great fruit. I                   
		absolutely believe that this will be the case. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">After the session, I will teach you a secret                   
		mantra. When you return home, if you want to recite the mantra you may,                   
		or if you want to recite the Buddha’s name you may. We’ll see who                   
		succeeds first in their cultivation. Does anyone have an opinion on                   
		this? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> Could we still speak about special                   
		occurrences? Yesterday during the hour sit, I felt a lot of electrical                   
		energy and at one moment I felt very large. My head was in the clouds                   
		and a rainy feeling was in the air. Later, I was once more in the clouds                   
		only this time I was talking with an entity and I did not want the rain

		teach you a mantra and I think now that some people are having a                   
		particular idle thought and there is something they want to say. If you                   
		want to speak, just go ahead. Someone is thinking, “I’m leaving                   
		tomorrow. I might not get a chance to learn it.” Isn’t that correct? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> Yes. </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Student:</b> Yes, thank you! </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> This is the most wonderful of                    
		mantras. Now I will teach it to you audibly, but when you recite it you                    
		should do so silently. Don’t speak it out loud, because it’s a secret                    
		mantra, and if you speak it out loud it won’t be a secret any longer.                    
		Walking, standing, sitting, and reclining, you should always recite this                    
		mantra.&nbsp; </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"> The mantra’s power is very great. For example, if you recite it                    
		in the mountains, after five hundred years have passed all the living                    
		creatures on the mountain will become Bodhisattvas. Its merit and virtue                    
		are that great. If you recite it in the water, after five hundred years                    
		all the living creatures in the water will bring forth the Bodhi resolve                    
		and in the future will become Bodhisattvas. Just recite it, and five                    
		hundred years later all the fleas, nits, and bed-bugs, and all the germs                    
		in your own body will also bring forth the thought of enlightenment and                    
		become Bodhisattvas. Is this or is this not powerful? If you yourself do                    
		not wish to become a Bodhisattva, helping other living beings to become                    
		Bodhisattvas is a good thing to do. Therefore, you can’t fail to recite                    
		this mantra. You should hurry up and recite it! </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">I will now transmit it to you and you should                    
		all pay special attention to it. If you already know the mantra, don’t                    
		think, “Oh, I know it,” and look on it lightly. Those who don’t know it                    
		should be even more respectful of this dharma. Now I will teach it to

		<p class="commentary_eng">I have a few more words to say to you. Please                    
		sit down. You should all remember that you took refuge at Buddha Root                    
		Farm. I gave young Joshua the Dharma name “Fruit of the Root,” (Guo Gen)                    
		because he is a Buddha root. All of you who have taken refuge here                    
		should be leaders of Buddhism. You must act as models for all peoples of                    
		the world. Be good Buddhist disciples and spread Buddhism throughout the                    
		entire world, throughout the Dharma Realm. If there is one person who                    
		does not believe in the Buddha, it will be because you have not                    
		fulfilled your responsibilities. You should vow to cause all people to                    
		take refuge with the Triple jewel. That will result in the greatest                    
		merit and virtue.&nbsp; </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><i> The Sutra of Comparative Merit and Virtue</i> says,&nbsp; </p>                  
        <blockquote>         
		<p class="commentary_eng"> “If                    
		there were Buddhas in number like the seedlings of rice, stalks of hemp,                    
		stalks of bamboo and reeds in the great trichiliocosm, and if you                    
		presented those Buddhas with the four kinds of offerings, and then, when                    
		those Buddhas passed into Nirvana, you again made offerings of incense                    
		and flowers, food and drink, and built shrines and temples for them, the                    
		resulting merit and virtue would be great indeed. However, when you                    
		yourself take refuge with the Triple Jewel and exhort others to take                    
		refuge, the merit from this exceeds the former.” </p>                   
        </blockquote>          
		<p class="commentary_eng">What are the four types of offerings? They                    
		are: food and drink, clothing, bedding, and medicine. Although the merit                    
		from offerings of flowers and incense and building shrines and temples                    
		is considerable, when you encourage one person to take refuge with the                    
		Triple Jewel and when you do so yourself, the merit from that action                    
		surpasses the merit obtained by making offerings to all those Buddhas.                    
		Thus, the result of taking refuge with the Triple Jewel is                    
		inconceivable. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Each of you should make Buddhism your own                    
		responsibility. Think, “Buddhism is just me; I am Buddhism.” Don’t set                    
		yourself apart from Buddhism. “Not only is Buddhism my religion, but I                    
		am going to convert those of other religions to Buddhism. This is my                    
		vow.” You should make the Four Vast Vows: </p>

		and they’re both supposed to come soon. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Master:</b> I have no comment on when Christ is                    
		due to come. As for Maitreya Bodhisattva, it’s still very early to look                    
		for his coming. Those who say that Maitreya is due simply do not                    
		understand the situation. Although Maitreya actually comes here all the                    
		time, he hasn’t yet become a Buddha. When we talk about the coming of                    
		Maitreya, this refers to his return as a Buddha, not just as an ordinary                    
		savior. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Every one hundred years our average height                    
		decreases by one inch and our average lifespan by one year. When the                    
		average human lifespan, which is now sixty or seventy years, has                    
		decreased to ten years, it will begin to increase again. When it reaches                    
		eighty-four thousand years, then it will start to decrease. When it has                    
		decreased to eighty thousand years, then Maitreya Buddha will appear in                    
		the world. So if you calculate the time, it is still in the distant                    
		future. Those who are coming now are Maitreya’s transformation bodies,                    
		not his true body, and they are not coming to manifest the attainment of                    
		Buddhahood. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Do you who are Christians know that Jesus                    
		disappeared for three years, during which time no one knew his                    
		whereabouts? During those three years, he went to India to study the                    
		Buddhadharma. Having studied the Buddhadharma, he preached about rebirth                    
		in the heavens and going to a heavenly paradise. This concept is pretty                    
		similar to what the Amitabha Sutra says. Jesus was also a part of                    
		Buddhism. He used those methods to teach and transform a certain kind of                    
		living beings, but ultimately, they will all go back to the root and                    
		return to the source and everyone will become a Buddha. But many people                    
		are unaware of this. (Added during translation: Jesus was a part of                    
		Buddhism. He was a Buddhist. However, he did not want to admit that he                    
		was Buddhist, so he did not preach Buddhism.) </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">A few days ago I said that all the world’s                    
		religions are included within Buddhism. This is because Buddhism takes                    
		the Dharma Realm, the universe, as its substance, and no living being                    
		can escape it. Other religions do not teach this. There are Ten Dharma                    
		Realms: The Dharma Realms of the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas, the                    
		Condition-Enlightened Ones, the Hearers, the gods, humans, asuras,                    
		animals, ghosts, and the beings in hell. No religion surpasses these Ten                    
		Dharma Realms and so all are included within Buddhism; none are not                    
		Buddhism. Although they might not admit to being a part of Buddhism,                    
		it’s only just a matter of time. In the future they will certainly                    
		acknowledge it. There will be no way they can avoid acknowledging it,                    
		since they can’t run outside of the Dharma Realm. Buddhism takes the                    
		Dharma Realm as its substance. I hope that you will all use effort and                    
		look into this doctrine. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Many people do not acknowledge that they are                    
		Buddhists, but this is no problem. Why don’t they acknowledge that they                    
		are Buddhists? Because they have not understood that they are within the                    
		Dharma Realm. They are like dreamers who are not in control of their                    
		actions. They are out of touch with what is really going on. They are                    
		also like the insane. Sometimes insane people don’t even know that they                    
		are human beings. When you ask them what they are, they may answer,                    
		“nothing at all,” or they may think that they are some strange creature                    
		of their own demented fantasy. When a person has lost touch with his                    
		humanity, you can’t rely on his own word when he tries to identify                    
		himself. In the same way, you can’t accept as reasonable the statement                    
		that one is not within the Ten Dharma Realms when it is made by someone

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>The Master:</b> There are other translations, but                    
		it is not a question of relative worth. Many previous translators of                    
		Buddhist texts were priests, ministers, scholars, or professional                    
		writers. Although they did translate Sutras, they didn’t necessarily                    
		understand the Buddhadharma. However, their translations cannot be said                    
		to be of no worth---they sell; people buy them. Thus they are worth                    
		something. But their principles do differ from the orthodox tradition.                    
		The translations done at Gold Mountain Monastery are done by Bhikshus,                    
		Bhkshunis, Shramaneras, Shramanerikas, laymen and laywomen, professors,                    
		and scholars of the Buddhadharma who all work together. They translate                    
		Sutras from within the Buddhadharma. Previous translations were largely                    
		done by people standing outside of Buddhism. Even if these Sutras were                    
		translated by Buddhists, they represent only one person’s opinion. They                    
		were not subjected to the scrutiny of others, not examined by many                    
		people, and inaccuracies passed unchecked into print. It is not, then, a

		<p class="commentary_eng">Previous translations do exist, but the                    
		difference is here: The translators have an external viewpoint---they do                    
		not stand inside the study and practice of the Dharma. “Outsiders” don’t

		who took refuge this afternoon. After this, anywhere you go, if people                    
		ask you who your teacher is and you want to admit that I am your                    
		teacher, you can tell him. “The stupidest person in the world is my                    
		teacher. His name is such and such. There isn’t anyone dumber or more                    
		ignorant than he is.” That’s how you should answer. Don’t say something                    
		like, “My teacher is really intelligent and he has all these good                    
		qualities.” Your teacher has no praiseworthy qualities. Don’t go around                    
		promoting your teacher and talking about how great he is. He doesn’t                    
		have any good qualities at all, only shortcomings. </p>                   
		<p class="commentary_eng">Whenever you go to a Buddhist temple you                    
		should be humble. Do not be arrogant. You should feel that everyone else                    
		is better than you, and that you have much to learn from them. For                    
		example, when you bow to the Buddha, don’t stand in the center aisle,                    
		because that is the space reserved for the Abbot. Bow off to one side.                    
		Don’t cause those who see you to think, “Oh, your teacher is really                    
		stupid. He hasn’t taught you anything. You don’t even know how to bow to                    
		the Buddha.” Then no matter how good you say your teacher is, no one                    
		will believe you. On the other hand, if you do everything well and                    
		according to the rules, then you won’t even have to say anything about                    
		your teacher being a good teacher. People will just take one look at you                    
		and think, “He’s so well-behaved and well-mannered; probably his teacher

		<p class="commentary_eng">Several days ago Guo Tong asked a question                   
		about why there were two Buddhas with the same name in the Amitabha                   
		Sutra. There were unreckonably many Buddhas with identical names. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">In the Land of Ultimate Bliss alone, there are                   
		three hundred and sixty billion, one hundred nineteen thousand, five                   
		hundred Buddhas all called the “Guiding Master, Amitabha Buddha.” The                   
		answer that Guo Hang gave to his question was correct. There are that                   
		many Amitabha Buddhas, all of whom guide living beings. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Yesterday, I said that Amitabha Buddha was                   
		like a magnet and that all living beings are like iron filings. When                   
		iron filings meet a magnet, they are irresistibly drawn to it. I also                   
		said that the other Buddhas were like magnets, but their magnetism was                   
		not as strong as Amitabha’s. Several people couldn’t sleep last night                   
		because they were having this false thought: “If all the Buddhas are                   
		like magnets, how come some have a stronger magnetic field than others?                   
		How can their powers be different?” Today, when I asked if there were                   
		any questions, no one dared bring the matter up, but I will answer it                   
		anyway. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">It is because Amitabha Buddha has made                   
		forty-eight vows, and these vows are like the power of a magnet. Other                   
		Buddhas have also realized Buddhahood, but they have not made these                   
		forty-eight vows and so their power is not as great. Thus, in                   
		cultivating the Way, one must make vows. If you have vows, they are                   
		certain to come true. Vows are like a lamp to light the path, it is very                   
		easy to travel. Each one of us should make vows in our cultivation. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">At Gold Mountain Monastery, every year on the                    
		eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, the anniversary of the                    
		enlightenment of Shakyamuni Buddha, those who wish to do so may make                    
		vows. That day is called “vow day.” Although the word vow (愿, <i>yuan</i>) in                    
		Chinese sounds the same as the word for resentment (怨, <i> yuan</i>), it is not                    
		a day of resentment. Some people resent heaven and blame their fellow                    
		human beings, saying, “Heaven! You really don’t know how to do your job.                    
		You are so unjust! And every soul on this Earth is wrong!” People like                    
		that think everybody else is in the wrong. That’s the day to make vows.                    
		You can make a vow about something you want to accomplish or about how                    
		you want to cultivate. Can one make vows at other times as well? Yes.                    
		However, that particular day is the anniversary of Shakyamuni Buddha’s                    
		enlightenment and so, when you make vows on that day, he is very                    
		pleased. “Oh! In the Saha world living being has made vows because of my                    
		enlightenment! These are supreme conditions!” </p>                   
      <p class="commentary_eng">And so he says, “Good indeed! Good indeed!                    
		Good man, good woman, you have made these vows and I shall certainly                    
		help you to fulfill them.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Yesterday, I taught you the mantra, “Om Mani                   
		Padme Hum,” and some people had these idle thoughts, “Perhaps I was one                   
		of the bugs on that Dharma Master’s body three or four hundred years                   
		ago. Since he recited the mantra, I’ve now become a human being and                   
		taken refuge with the Triple Jewel. Could that be the case?” That’s                   
		their false thought. Well, I’m not going to answer that question. Maybe                   
		Little Guo Fang was such a bug. She likes to eat candy and when I                   
		recited the mantra it probably kept turning things into candy. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Today I will continue speaking about Amitabha                   
		Buddha. It’s not the case that there’s just one Buddha or two Buddhas.                   
		In fact, there are as many Buddhas as there are grains of sand in the                   
		River Ganges, and they dwell in the ten directions. What are the ten                   
		directions? They are: north, east, south, west, northeast, northwest,                   
		southeast, southwest---that’s eight directions. Then add the zenith and                   
		the nadir and you have ten directions. In each of the ten directions                   
		there are Buddhas in number like the sands in the Ganges. The Buddha is                   
		a living being who has become enlightened. As many living beings as                   
		there are, there are that many Buddhas. Can you count the number of                   
		living beings that currently exist? There’s no way to count them. You                   
		can’t even reckon the exact number of human beings. You might figure out                   
		the number of people in one country, but you don’t necessarily know the                   
		population of all the countries in the world. There’s no way to come up                   
		with an accurate figure, no matter what scientific methods you use,                   
		including computers!&nbsp; </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"> Even if you could count the human population, could                   
		you count the mosquitoes? How many are there in one country? How many                   
		are there in the whole world? You can’t count the mosquitoes; you can’t                   
		count the ants; you can’t count the bees. All the insects, the birds,                   
		and all other living creatures are also uncountable. And the Buddhas are                   
		also like that. There are so many you could never count them. For every                   
		living being, there is a Buddha, and that Buddha will take that living                   
		being across. Thus, we talk about the Buddhas of the three periods of                   
		time throughout the ten directions. The three periods of time are; the                   
		past, the present, and the future. A few days ago I mentioned that some                   
		people do not believe in past, present, and future lives, especially                   
		rich people. They don’t believe at all in future lives. They just enjoy                   
		themselves, thinking that if they can make a fortune in their business,                   
		they are “getting the most out of life.” But they are wrong. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why is one wealthy in one’s present life? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">It’s because in the past one made offerings to                   
		the Sangha and aided the poor. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why are you wealthy and honored in this life?                   
		It’s because you practiced charity in past lives. It’s said, “Renounce                   
		one, and gain ten thousand in return.” If you gave away a penny in a                   
		past life, in this life you get it back ten thousand times as interest.                  
		</p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why is one poor in one’s present life? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">It’s because in the past one refused to aid                   
		the poor. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">In past lives, when you had money, you didn’t                   
		give, and so now you are poor. You were afraid if you gave away your                   
		money that you wouldn’t have any for yourself. “I’ll be stone broke. Why                   
		should I give my money away? That’s too stupid.” You held on to every                   
		single cent, squeezing it so tightly that it melted in your hand. You                   
		would rather have it melt than let go of it. That’s how stingy you were.                   
		Those so terribly afraid of being poor, in their next life are, in fact,                   
		poor. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why is one handsome in one’s present life? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">It’s because in the past one offered incense,                   
		flowers, and lamps to the Buddha. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Suppose a person is extremely attractive.                   
		Everyone who meets him respects him and is fond of him. In general, no                   
		one dislikes him. Why is this? It’s because that person made offerings                   
		of incense and flowers, and lit lamps before the Buddhas in past lives.                  
		</p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Everything is a matter of cause and effect. So                   
		it doesn’t matter whether in your past lives you were an American                   
		Indian, American, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Burmese, or Sri Lankan---at                   
		some time or another you changed your residence. You may live in one                   
		“house” for a while, but eventually you will have to pack up and move.                   
		The principle of cause and effect works in human life in the same way.                   
		There’s nothing strange about it at all. In the world: </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">The good flock together, and the evil run in                   
		packs; People seek out their own kind. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Buddhists associate with Buddhists. Those who                   
		believe in ghosts gather with those who believe in ghosts. Those who                   
		have faith in demons stay with those who have faith in demons. Students                   
		associate with students. Politicians associate with politicians,                   
		businessmen with businessmen, laborers with laborers, ginseng growers                   
		with ginseng growers. (this was added during translation) So that’s what                   
		is meant by, “The good flock together, and the evil run in packs; people                   
		seek out their own kind.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Now we are all investigating the Buddhadharma,                   
		and we did so in former lives. In former lives we made vows to propagate                   
		the Buddhadharma, and in this life, quite unconsciously, we have gone                   
		down that road again. This is because we vowed to spread the Dharma in                   
		past lives. Here in this country where there is no Buddhadharma, because                   
		of past vows, we have come to help the Buddhadharma grow and prosper. In                   
		past lives we made such vows, in the present we are carrying them out,                   
		and in the future they will be fulfilled. So don’t ask what nationality                   
		you were in a past life or how you have been reborn in America. No                   
		matter what nationality you were in your last life, you were a person.                   
		So you don’t need to ask. Do you understand? You still don’t know? Then                   
		you’re really dreaming. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">No matter what nationality people are, they                   
		should be good towards everyone. They should think, “If someone is bad                   
		to me, I will forgive them. I will treat everyone well. I will forget                   
		the evil done to me. I will look for the good points in others and not                   
		for their faults.” If everyone were like that, there would be no war in                   
		the world. Why are there wars? It’s because everyone looks for the                   
		faults in others, and no one looks for the good points. So, day by day,                   
		there is more and more trouble in the world. </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b> Dhyana Master Gao Fengmiao                   
		always fell asleep during his meditations and so to prevent this he went                   
		to sit on top of a mountain. He sat atop a rock which looked like an                   
		inverted lotus, and the drop was who knows how far. He knew that if he                   
		fell asleep he would fall over the edge and be smashed to a pulp. The                   
		first day he sat very well. The second day went fine. But on the third                   
		day he dozed off and slipped over the edge. “I’m finished!” he thought,                   
		but just then Weitou Bodhisattva reached out his hand and snatched him                   
		out of the air. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Gao Fengmiao thought, “Weitou Bodhisattva is                   
		protecting me. How many cultivators are there like me in the world?” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">“There are as many as the hairs on a cow,”                   
		answered Weitou, “and since you are so arrogant, I won’t protect your                   
		Dharma for the next eighty thousand great eons.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Hearing this, Gao Fengmiao was deeply ashamed.                   
		He repented earnestly. He cried and cried until he even forgot about                   
		sleeping. He cried himself into a stupor, forgetting everything, until                   
		suddenly, as if waking from a dream, he realized, “Before I knew that                   
		Weitou was protecting my Dharma, I cultivated the Way. Now, I will                   
		continue to cultivate whether he protects me or not. And he sat down                   
		again, more determined than ever. It wasn’t long, however, before he                   
		fell asleep again and fell over the edge. Oddly enough, the same hand                   
		reached out and caught him. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">“Who’s that protecting my Dharma?” he asked.                   
		“It’s me, Weitou Bodhisattva,” came the reply. “Hey, Old Wei,” said Gao                   
		Fengmiao, “You don’t keep the precepts either. You told a lie.” “I did                   
		not,” countered Weitou. “You said you wouldn’t protect my Dharma for                   
		eighty thousand eons and here you are protecting my Dharma,” challenged                   
		Gao Fengmiao. Weitou replied, “Because of your one thought of genuine                   
		repentance, you overstepped eighty thousand great eons of retribution                   
		and so I came to save you.” </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">The important point was that in his one                   
		thought of repentance, he was able to cancel out, to pass beyond, as it                   
		were, eighty thousand eons. That should answer your question. If the                   
		“schedule” for enlightenment was fixed, it would turn into a dead                   
		dharma, not a live dharma. It would be a fixed dharma, and there simply                   
		are no fixed dharmas. Shakyamuni Buddha cultivated for three great                   
		asamkhyeyas of eons, but that’s just a manner of speaking. Three great                   
		asamkhyeyas of eons don’t go beyond a single thought; one thought is                   
		just three great asamkhyeyas of eons. Haven’t you been listening to the                   
		Avatamsaka Sutra? Do you know how many great asamkhyeyas of eons you                   
		have already cultivated? Maybe you have been cultivating for six great                   
		asamkhyeyas of eons. </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Disciple:</b> The Gold Mountain Doctrine in two

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master: </b>The phrase “making                   
		revolution in the Sangha” is not part of the doctrine itself. The first                   
		three statements are the Gold Mountain Doctrine: “Freezing, we do not                   
		scheme. Starving, we do not beg. Dying of poverty, we ask for nothing.”                   
		What follows is the transmitting of the Buddha’s mind-seal in accord                   
		with true principle. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Disciple:</b> I was wondering, since you are the

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master: </b>It is just because we are                   
		the Orthodox Dharma that we need a revolution. Every place else, it’s                   
		the Dharma-ending Age. If you don’t reform the Dharma-ending Age,      
        you're                   
		neglecting your responsibility. Revolution refers to revolution in the                   
		Dharma-ending Age, not in the Orthodox Dharma.&nbsp; </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"> You don’t realize how                   
		things are done in Asian Buddhism. For example, during the Incense                   
		Praise, the abbot lights the first stick of incense and when he is done                   
		he signals to the lay people to offer incense. The one who wants to                   
		light the first stick has to pay $5,000 or $50,000 [added during                   
		translation] and only then can he approach the altar. Not just anyone                   
		can go up and light incense. The first person to light incense pays                   
		$5,000, the second, $4,000, and the third, $3,000. That’s a fixed rule.                   
		In the Dharma assembly, the one who gives the most the money is the                   
		greatest Dharma protector. Do you think this is right? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Here, everyone is equal. It’s not the case                   
		that if you give more money you go first, and if you give only a little                   
		you must stand behind. In China, monks recite Sutras for people, to help                   
		the dead, and for this service one pays $10,000 or maybe $100,000. It’s                   
		not fixed. In general, “the more money, the better.” “If you have a lot                   
		of money, you are good.” Asian Buddhism is this way. Here, if you give a                   
		lot of money, it’s okay. If you don’t give money, it’s also okay. If you                   
		like to do good things, it’s okay. If you don’t like doing good things,                   
		it’s okay. Everything’s okay. That is what is meant by “making                   
		revolution in the Sangha.” We are not like Asian Buddhism, which sees                   
		money as all-important, and sees other things, such as the Sutras, the                   
		Dharma, the Buddha, and the Sangha, as really low. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">That’s how it is in Asian Buddhism. The monks                   
		play the wooden fish---“dong, dong, dong”---and hit the bell, and then                   
		ask for money. If you bow to the Buddha, you have to give money.                   
		Otherwise, the Buddha won’t notice you. If you give more money, the                   
		Buddha’s eyes may open wider. This is the kind of attitude that leads to                   
		the Dharma-ending Age. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">At Gold Mountain Monastery, we don’t do it                   
		that way. Here, the poor and the rich bow to the Buddha on equal ground.                   
		There is no discrimination. It’s not the case that if you give more                   
		money, you’re number one. At gold Mountain Monastery, it’s not that we                   
		don’t accept money, rather we don’t place such great importance on it.                  
		</p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">This kind of an attitude is revolutionary!                   
		This is “revolution in the Sangha.” We are making revolution against the                   
		improper elements of Buddhism. All the improper customs and habits must                   
		be eliminated. Thus, we uphold the Orthodox Dharma by purging it of its                   
		“unorthodox” elements. We want to do away with the Dharma-ending Age and                   
		usher in the Orthodox Dharma. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">That was a good question. How can the Orthodox                   
		Dharma conduct a revolution? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">The following sentences say, “We accord with                   
		conditions, but do not change.” This means that we follow the                   
		conditions, but do not stray from the basic doctrines. We don’t go                   
		around criticizing others and in this way we “accord with conditions.”                   
		If other people do things differently, we don’t hinder them. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">However, we never change in our basic                   
		principles. We insist on doing things correctly ourselves and that’s                   
		what is meant by “we do not change, but accord with conditions.” Do you                   
		understand? </p>

      <p class="commentary_eng"><b>Amitabha Buddha is number one.</b> This is because                   
		of the power of his vows. This power is so great that when you recite                   
		“Na Mo E Mi Tuo Fo,” you can very quickly realize Buddhahood. To become                   
		a Buddha, all you need to do is recite the Buddha’s name. The                   
		Dharma-door of Buddha Recitation works on the same principle as the                   
		mother-son relationship. Those who recite the Buddha’s name are like the                   
		“sons” and the Buddha is like everyone’s “mother.” Whoever recites                   
		Amitabha Buddha’s name is like Amitabha Buddha’s son.&nbsp; </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"> If the son                   
		leaves his mother, it is hard for his mother to find him again. But if                   
		the son wants to find his mother, all he has to do is return home. If                   
		the mother thinks of her son, but the son cares not for his mother, he                   
		will run farther and farther away. If the mother thinks of her son and                   
		the son is mindful of his mother, then they will always be together. We

		five precepts? </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b> As to the five precepts,                   
		they prohibit killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and taking                   
		intoxicants. Why should one keep the five precepts? In order to “do no                   
		evil, but reverently practice good deeds.” Do not kill; do not steal; do                   
		not commit sexual misconduct; do not engage in false speech; do not take                   
		intoxicants. If you observe the five precepts, you do not do these five                   
		kinds of evil deeds and you instead practice good acts. </p>                  
		<p class="commentary_eng">Why should one refrain from killing? It is                   
		because all living beings have a life; they love their life and they do                   
		not wish to die. Even one of the smallest creatures, the mosquito, when                   
		it approaches to bite you, will fly away if you make the slightest                   
		motion. Why does it fly away? Because it fears death. It figures that if                   
		it drinks your blood you will take its life. From this you can see that                   
		all living beings love life and do not wish to die. Especially people.                   
		Everyone wants to live and no one wants to die. Although people                   
		sometimes commit suicide, ordinarily people do not seek death. Suicide                   
		is a special exception to the principle. That is why we should nurture                   
		compassionate thoughts. Since we wish to live, we should not kill any                   
		other living beings. That explains the precept against killing. </p>

		precepts. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">Some people say, “Of the five precepts, the                  
		four which prohibit killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying are                  
		very important. But taking intoxicants is a very commonplace thing. Why                  
		prohibit that?” When you consume intoxicants, it becomes very easy to                  
		break the other precepts. Thus, we ban such things as drinking alcohol,                  
		smoking tobacco, and taking any kind of intoxicating drugs. Some people                  
		say, “The five precepts don’t specifically prohibit smoking tobacco or                  
		taking drugs. Doing those things is not in violation of the precepts.”                  
		These people are wrong. The precept against intoxicants also prohibits                  
		smoking tobacco, taking drugs, and using all intoxicating                  
		substances---including marijuana and opium. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">Once there was a layman who received the five                  
		precepts. At first they were very important to him and he strictly                  
		observed them. After a time, his old bad habits surfaced and he longed                  
		for a taste of wine. He thought, “Among the five precepts, the one                  
		against drinking is really unnecessary. What’s wrong with a little glass                  
		of wine?” He bought several pints of brandy and downed them.&nbsp; </p>                
		<p class="commentary_eng"> As he was                  
		drinking, the neighbor’s little chicken ran into his house. “They’ve                  
		sent me a snack!” he thought. “I’ll put this chicken on the menu to help                  
		send down my brandy.” He then grabbed the bird and killed it. This is a                  
		distinctly Chinese story and not a Western story. Why? Chinese people                  
		like to eat hors d’oeuvres with their alcohol. Westerners don’t need                  
		snacks to send off their wine. So, this layman couldn’t possibly have                  
		been a Westerner. Anyway, because he drank the wine, he wanted the meat                  
		and thus broke the precept against killing. Since he took the chicken                  
		without the owner’s permission, he also broke the precept against                  
		stealing. Then the neighbor lady walked in and said, “Say, did you see                  
		my chicken?” </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">Drunk as he was, and full of chicken, he                  
		slurred, “No…I didn’t see no chicken. Your old pu…pu….pullet didn’t run                  
		over here.” So saying, he broke the precept against lying. Then he took                  
		a look at the woman---she was quite pretty---and forthwith he broke the                  
		precept against sexual misconduct. A little drink of brandy led him to                  
		transgress all five of the precepts. Therefore, the precepts against                  
		taking intoxicants is also very important. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">You may be wondering, “You have said that to                  
		keep the precepts is to do no evil and to practice all good deeds, but I                  
		wonder if this is really the case?” </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">If you have your doubts, then of course there                  
		will be problems. But if you have no doubts, your good roots will                  
		certainly deepen and grow stronger. What is more, when you receive the                  
		five precepts, for each precept you receive, five Dharma-protecting good                  
		spirits come to support you and protect you. After receiving the five                  
		precepts, if you keep them well, you can turn disasters into lucky                  
		occurrences and transform difficulties into auspicious events. You will                  
		encounter no tragedies or calamities. Those are the advantages of

		greed, hatred, and delusion. Greed: You might say that greed is just                  
		insatiable desire. Then, if you fail to obtain the object of your

		views are expressed, rather than proper knowledge and views. The second

		faults to the first party. “Do you know what Lee said about you?” he                  
		says to John, and then to lee he says, “Do you know what insulting

		yesterday about the invisible playmates. She said they disappeared as                  
		soon as the child started to slander them. If invisible friends                  
		disappeared as soon as the child started to slander them, you can bet                  
		that the visible ones would be even more upset. Now “double-tongues. It means that you speak

		good acts are created through the three karmas of body, mouth, and mind.                  
		When the three karmas are pure, you will not commit the three types of

		misconduct prohibit all sexual conduct between men and women, or does it                  
		allow it between husband and wife? My girlfriend and I are not

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Disciple:</b> As to the precept of not lying,                  
		there is the so-called “lie of silence.” For example, the American                  
		government would allow us to make war on Vietnam because the people of                  
		this country did not stand up to say it was not alright to do that, so                  
		those officials say, “Well, we’re doing fine, because no one says we’re                  
		not doing fine. If you don’t stand up and speak out against evil, then                  
		you’re complying with the forces that bring it about. Is being silent in

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b> Yes, it is, but it is still                  
		a little better than actually speaking a lie. Of course, lying through                  
		silence is not allowed, but actually speaking a lie is even less                  
		correct. It is to be hoped that such things would not occur. But if you

		food. Monosodium glutamate and other chemicals are sneaked into our                  
		food. The caffeine in the coffee we drink is a drug. Ginseng has drugs                  
		in it. On the other side of it, peyote, although it has toxins in it,                  
		it’s a spiritual tool that’s traditionally been used by the American                  
		Indians for a long, long time. And it’s a Dharma door, so to speak, that

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b> The reason for the precept

		people go insane. They can make people go crazy and act in upside-down                  
		ways. If you take a small amount and it doesn’t confuse you, that’s                  
		okay. It’s only to be feared that you start out taking a little, but you                  
		end up taking a lot. For example, people who drink alcohol may start out                  
		with one glass, then drink another glass because they don’t realize they                  
		are tipsy. People who drink usually won’t admit that they are drunk.                  
		Even if they are drunk, they say they aren’t. I’ve seen a lot of people                  
		who are like that. They drink a little, and then some more, and then                  
		more. That’s the reason for the precept. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">If you use a little bit as medicine to cure an                  
		illness, it is acceptable. If you are not sick, then you don’t need to                  
		use this medicine. Just now ginseng was mentioned. Ginseng is not                  
		poisonous. It is sweet in nature. “Ginseng has a sweet flavor and is                  
		very bolstering to the constitution. It quenches thirst, helps to                  
		produce saliva, regulates the complexion, and nurtures the stomach.”                  
		What advantages does it have? If you are thirsty and you eat it, it will                  
		quench your thirst. It also produces saliva. It nourishes your inherited                  
		constitution (<i>yuan-qi</i>). The <i> qi</i> or energy in your <i>dan-tian</i> (near your                  
		abdomen) is called central energy (<i>zhong-qi</i>). The inherited constitution                  
		is the energy that gives rise to your central energy. It is the source                  
		of energy. Ginseng bolsters your energy. If you are weak, eat some                  
		ginseng and you will feel invigorated. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">Many Chinese Dharma Masters, when they give                  
		lectures, have to drink ginseng tea, because lecturing drains their                  
		energy, and the ginseng tea helps to replenish it. So, “ginseng has a                  
		sweet flavor and is very bolstering to the constitution. It quenches                  
		thirst, helps to produce saliva…” If you are very thirsty, drink ginseng                  
		and it will cure your thirst. It “regulates the complexion, and nurtures                  
		the stomach.” Regulating the complexion means regulating the blood, and                  
		nurturing the stomach means nurturing one’s energy. That’s ginseng. </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">You have to know the functions of each                  
		medicinal herb. You can’t just take a little of this and a little of                  
		that. If you do that, then even if you were healthy to begin with, you                  
		could end up getting sick. Medicines are for curing sickness. If you                  
		aren’t sick, you don’t need to take them. Some people say, “I feel                  
		tired, I think I’ll take some drug to make my tiredness go away.” If you                  
		feel tired, just take a rest and then you’ll be fine. You don’t need to                  
		take medicine. </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Disciple:</b> We ate some ginseng here. It creates                  
		a very yang state that some people have a hard time handling. The tide                  
		flow will block up in the shoulders or the back for awhile, and some

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b>  If it’s too yang for

		it. Just follow the middle path.&nbsp; </p>                
		<p class="commentary_eng"> For example, if you can carry a hundred                  
		pounds and you take some ginseng so you can carry 150 pounds, that’s                  
		going overboard. If you have a cup, you want to fill it up full. But if                  
		you keep pouring after it is full and it overflows, it’s the same as not                  
		being full.&nbsp; </p>                
		<p class="commentary_eng"> Suppose you feel very weak and lacking in energy, so your                  
		voice is very soft and you can’t speak any louder. If your vital energy                  
		is weak and you pant when you walk, then ginseng can help to bolster                  
		your energy.&nbsp; </p>                
		<p class="commentary_eng"> It’s not the case that everyone should take ginseng,                  
		especially when they are not sick. If one is not sick, then one should                  
		take it very sparingly. Even once a month is already quite substantial.                  
		One should not take it every day. If one is taking pure ginseng, one                  
		should only take one or two qian (1 qian is 1/10th of a Chinese ounce),                  
		or about half an ounce. And one should take ginseng only in the three                  
		winter months, not during the rest of the year. </p>

		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Disciple:</b> As to the precept against taking                  
		life as it relates to not eating meat, I want to ask how we can live                  
		without taking life. Plants, for example, seem to have a higher                  
		consciousness than most animals. They have a consciousness that’s                  
		everywhere at once. They display emotions such as fear and recognize                  
		individuals. Personally I don’t feel any more comfortable eating plants                  
		than I do eating animals. According to scientific experiments, you can                  
		pinch one plant here and its partner will feel the pain at exactly the                  
		same time even though it is a thousand miles away. Since they have                  
		emotions, how can we kill and eat them any more easily than we can kill                  
		and eat animals? </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng"><b>Venerable Master:</b> That which has a life is                  
		said to be “sentient.” Plants are said to be “insentient.” This includes                  
		the earth, wood, rocks, and minerals. Rocks may appear insentient, but                  
		they are alive. Their “life” is a bit less, however; it’s not as                  
		complete, and they cannot be compared with human beings, who have eight                  
		consciousnesses. Although we can say that plants have some sort of                  
		awareness, it is incomplete. That’s why we have the term, “senseless                  
		rocks.” Although they are said to be senseless, they actually do have                  
		emotional feelings. What proof is there? </p>                 
		<p class="commentary_eng">In China, Dharma Master Dao-sheng lectured on                  
		the Nirvana Sutra at <i>Hu-qiu</i> Mountain. The first half of the Nirvana Sutra                  
		said that icchantikas, that is, unbelievers, did not have the Buddha                  
		nature. Dharma Master Dao-sheng said, “Icchantikas also have the Buddha                  
		nature.” When he said that, all the other Dharma Masters objected. “The                  
		Sutra plainly says that icchantikas don’t have the Buddha nature; how                  
		can you say that they do?” and they told everyone to avoid his lectures.                  
		So he went up to <i>Hu-qiu</i> Mountain and lectured to rocks. He addressed                  
		them, saying, “I say that icchantikas have the Buddha nature. What do                  
		you say?” At that point the rocks nodded their heads! It is said, </p>

		world? If you were to be very strict in your interpretation, then even                  
		eating plants is killing. But it’s a bit less serious. If you did not                  
		eat, you could not stay alive. “Killing” vegetables is less offensive to                  
		one’s compassionate sensibilities than wantonly killing animals for                  
		food. Killing animals creates thoughts of hatred, not of compassion.                  
		Your compassion grows lighter while your hatred increases. His question

		<p class="commentary_eng">Since plants have no blood or breath, how can

		can turn into a human being. It can transform into a child and run
