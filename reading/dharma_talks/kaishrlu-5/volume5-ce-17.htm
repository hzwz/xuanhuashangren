In life after life, people have been slaughtering and devouring one another. The hatred in the resulting "meat stew" is as deep as the sea. Human beings have taken the lives of the smaller and weaker creatures by force, ignoring the fact that all beings wish to live and are afraid of dying. Before those creatures die, their minds are overwhelmed by hatred and thoughts of revenge. There is no way to quell the feelings of enmity.

The one outside is trying to get in, and the one inside is trying to get out. He is trapped inside this pen of death by the person outside.
                <p class="commentary4">This character depicts one person eating the flesh of another. The one eating the meat is on the outside, still in human form, while the one being eaten is trapped inside and has already turned into an animal. Even though the mouth is open, his escape is blocked by the person outside. The box could represent a sheep pen, a pig pen, or a cattle pen. The one about to be eaten lives inside, while the person outside stands guard, because he wants to eat the flesh of the one inside.

                所以这吃肉的人与被吃的人就有一种关系，互相罩着，解不开冤结了。我们人是众生，所吃的肉也是众生，无论什么动物，牛、羊、马、鸡、犬、猪等，都是众生之一。有人就说：“这些众生是天生来给人吃的。”那么如果说，动物是预备给人吃的，那人又是预备给谁吃的呢？所以天生的物质，不一定是给人吃的。只是人弱肉强食，人比其它动物高明，就想吃其它动物的肉。

We are beings, and yet we eat the flesh of other beings, such as cows, sheep, horses, chickens, dogs, and pigs. Some people say God put these animals here for us to eat. If people are supposed to eat animals, who is supposed to eat people? Creatures, whether or not put here by God, aren't necessarily meant for human consumption. Since humans are slightly more intelligent than other animals, they prey on and devour the flesh of their weaker fellow creatures.

In light of this, you ought to consider whether the person being eaten (who has already taken the form of a cow, sheep, horse, or pig) might have been related to you.
                <p class="commentary4">The <em>Shurangama Sutra</em> says, "Sheep can become people again." If sheep can turn back into people, other animals should be able to do so as well. We fail to recognize them because they have changed costumes and faces. Has it ever occurred to you that these pigs, cows, and sheep could be your old friends and relatives? In fact, they may very well have been your parents from last life, from this life, or from some life beginningless eons ago. How unfilial it would be to eat the flesh of your own parents!

                志公祖师说，真是古怪得很啊！什么事古怪呢？孙子娶祖母。当这孙子一出生的时候，他的祖母就有病了，一直到临终时，她还挂念着孙子，恐怕没有人照顾他，将来谁帮助他成家立业呢？因此当她咽下最后一口气时，手还拉着孙儿的手，恋恋不舍地死去了。

Right before the grandmother died, she worried that no one would take care of her young grandson. Who would help him raise a family and establish his career in the future?

                到了阴间，见到阎罗王，她就痛哭流涕地哀求，说：“阎罗王啊！请你做一点好事啦！我世间的孙儿没有人照顾，请你让我回去照顾他好吗？”阎罗王慈悲为怀，答应她的请求，说：“好的！
				你可以回去照顾他。你本来是他的祖母，现在你就回去做他的太太吧！”祖母业不由己，就又投胎到阳世做个女孩子，长大后就和她的孙儿结婚。只是改头换面，穿另一件衣服，大家就都不认识了。但是志公祖师认识，所以说：“古古怪！怪怪古！孙子娶祖母。”

                <p class="commentary4">King Yama, who had a soft heart, said, "Okay, you can go back and be his wife!" And so the grandmother was reborn into the world as a girl, and when she grew up she married her former grandson. She had merely changed her appearance, putting on a different costume, but no one recognized whom she was. Only Venerable Patriarch Zhi recognized her, and so he said, "Strange indeed! Strange indeed! The grandson marries the grandmother."

                志公祖师又见到一个小女孩正啃着猪蹄，他就说：“女食母之肉。”这女孩的母亲造了很重的罪业，所以托生变成猪了，现在被人屠宰做了美食，所以小女孩吃她母亲的肉。又看见院子里有个男孩子正高兴地拍打驴皮鼓，志公祖师就说了：“子打父皮鼓。”男孩的父亲也因为造罪，托生为驴，死后被人剥了皮做鼓。可是这小男孩不知是他父亲的皮做成的鼓，只会欢喜地玩耍打鼓。

The girl's mother had been reborn as a pig because of the grave offenses she had committed. The pig had been slaughtered and used in preparing a gourmet dish, and now the little girl was eating her own mother's flesh.
                <p class="commentary4">Patriarch Zhi then looked in the courtyard and saw a boy happily beating on a drum stretched with mule hide. He said, "The son beats on his father's skin." The boy's father had committed offenses and had been reborn as a mule. After the mule had died, its hide had been used to make the drum. Not knowing that the drum was made from his father's skin, the boy was merrily beating on it.

                <p class="commentary4">Then the Patriarch glanced over at the couch and saw that the relatives sitting there were pigs, cows, and sheep that had been eaten in the past. And the meat cooking in the pot had been the six types of close relatives in the past. And so, Patriarch Zhi said, "Everyone here thinks this is a joyous occasion and congratulates the host on getting a new daughter-in-law. But from my point of view, this is true suffering!" Everyone is caught in the cycle of birth and death, paying off debts by killing and eating one another. This is indescribable suffering. If you don't eat the flesh of others, you yourself will not be eaten. "Dharma Master," you say, "I simply can't believe you!" If you don't believe me, that's OK! Go ahead and try it out yourself !
