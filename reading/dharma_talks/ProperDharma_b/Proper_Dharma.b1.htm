These twenty-eight lines tell us to take refuge in all the Buddhas, all the Bodhisattvas, all the Hearers, all Those Enlightened by Conditions, and all the gods throughout empty space and the Dharma Realm. The last line, &quot;Na mo yin tuo la ye,&quot; refers to what Chinese people call the Jade Emperor. Those who do not understand the Buddhadharma say, &quot;The Jade Emperor belongs to Daoism. We shouldn't bow to him.&quot; They don't realize that the Jade Emperor is just Lord Shakra. As Buddhist disciples, we should also respect him and gather him in. This first section of the Shurangama Mantra is the section for protecting and supporting the Triple Jewel. Therefore, when this section is recited, all the demons, goblins, ghosts, and other strange creatures flee far away. They retreat as far as they can go. </td>

                <p class="commentary4">                  Therefore, in Buddhism it is said that if there is even one person in the world who can recite the Shurangama Mantra, then the demons, goblins, ghosts, and all the other weird creatures will not dare to openly show themselves in the world. If not even one person can recite the Shurangama Mantra from memory, then at that point all the demons, goblins, ghosts, and all the other weird creatures will appear in the world. They will wreak havoc, but no one will recognize them. Right now, since there are still people who can recite the Shurangama Mantra, the demons, goblins, ghosts, and all the other weird creatures don't dare to openly show themselves in the world. There is a verse which expresses the meaning of this section of mantra. <br>

It is Vajra that supports and protects this mantra, which comes from our own Buddha-nature. <em>The Shurangama Mantra contains miraculous wonders.</em> The Shurangama Mantra is also known as a magical text. It is very miraculous and especially potent. That's why it is said, &quot;The Shurangama Mantra contains miraculous wonders.&quot; <em>Cultivators and ordinary people can open the Five Eyes and Six Penetrations.</em> If you constantly recite the Shurangama Mantra with single-minded concentration, not thinking of anything else, you can attain the Five Eyes and the Six Penetrations.

                <p class="commentary4"> Most scholars say the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em> is false and claim that it was not spoken by the Buddha. They say they have various pieces of evidence and documents to support it. This is all because they fear the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em> and have no way to deal with the principles in the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. What they fear most in the Shurangama Sutra are the Four Clear Instructions on Purity. The Four Clear Instructions on Purity serve as a demon-spotting mirror. All the demons, goblins, ghosts, and weird creatures are reflected in their true form. Furthermore, the section on the Fifty Skandha-demons exposes the celestial demons and externalists to the bone, enabling people to recognize their demonic appearance.

During the ninety-six days of summer vacation, I lectured on the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em> to those college students. During that time, there was only a half day's break on Saturdays. Aside from that, I lectured on the Sutra every day, and they all took notes. In the beginning, I lectured once a day, and then they studied on their own. After half a month, I assessed the time and the length of the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. Fearing that I might not finish in time, I began lecturing twice a day. After a while, I calculated again and decided that I still would not be able to finish, so I started lecturing three times a day. Finally, in the last half month or more, I lectured four times a day. <br>

There are many hippies hanging out in Golden Gate Park, and Dharma Master Hsuan Hua goes there to meditate. When the hippies see him meditating, they are curious and go up to talk to him. Then Dharma Master Hsuan Hua tells them to go visit the temple. They go to the temple and find that the lifestyle there is pretty similar to their hippie lifestyle, so they all leave the home-life.&quot; <br>

The hippies take LSD and marijuana. They can get high on just one capsule of LSD and feel as carefree as if they were in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. But Dharma Master Hsuan Hua can take more than ten capsules without being affected in the least. He doesn't get high or feel as carefree as if he were in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.

Bad people teach me how I should not be, and I learn to not be like them. That's why all people are my teachers. &quot;I always teach myself.&quot; We ourselves must always be alert and not make mistakes, not act in ignorance. We should use bright wisdom in handling all matters instead of using stupidity and ignorance to take care of things. We must turn states around, rather than being turned by states. &quot;Do not fail to perform a good deed, thinking it is trivial. Do not perform an evil deed, thinking it is insignificant.&quot; Don't think, &quot;That good deed is trivial. I'm not going to do it. That bad deed is really minor. I'll go ahead and do it. It doesn't matter.&quot; For example, you think, &quot;I'm vegetarian, but it won't matter if I eat an egg.&quot; But in the future when you are reborn as a chicken, you will know that it was because you ate chicken eggs. If you are not clear in these small matters, then you are &quot;mixing good and evil, and the retribution will not be off.&quot; It's not fun at all. <br>
