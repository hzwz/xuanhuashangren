He lived about twenty miles south of Harbin in Da-nan-gou Village. Before he took refuge with the Triple Jewel, he was a loafer who smoked opium and shot himself up with morphine.

			当时日本统治东北，成立满洲国，利用清朝废帝宣统，做满洲国的皇帝，成为日本的傀儡，一切的政权操纵在日本人手中。日本为了防止苏联的侵略，于是在黑河一带建筑国防工程，到处抓劳工去服役，只有贡献，没有酬劳。凡是进到劳工营的人，只有终日忧愁，不知何年才能回到温暖的家乡。谈起劳工营的生活，就令人不寒而栗，那简直是人间地狱，苦不堪言。</td>

They conscripted laborers everywhere for their defense construction projects in the Black River area, which were aimed at preventing the Soviet Union from invading. The laborers were forced to work without pay, and they never knew when they would be able to return to their hometowns. The labor camps were hell on earth; the suffering was beyond words. It made people shiver just to speak of their experience there.</td>

During the day he was forced to toil like an ox, and at night he slept in a bale of grass which did not protect him from the cold. He constantly tried to find ways to escape. The camp was surrounded by a high-voltage electric fence which would electrify anything that touched it. Unable to take the cruel treatment, he constantly sought for a chance to escape, notwithstanding the electric barrier. </td>

When they reached the electric fence, the white dog jumped over it. Guo Shun knew he was supposed to follow suit. In a sudden inspiration, he took a bale of grass, put it over the fence, and then jumped over it. He was safe. When he turned around, the white dog was gone. Perhaps it had been a heavenly being coming to his aid.</td>

He dared to walk only at night. After many days of arduous travel, he arrived in his hometown. After his experience in the labor camp, he felt that life was full of suffering, and so he decided to become a monk and practice the spiritual path. He went to all the temples, but none would take him in. When he went to Three Conditions Monastery, people would not accept him there either because they thought he was a beggar (from his ragged clothes) who wanted to become a monk just so he could get food and shelter.</p></td>

Guo Shun bowed to him as his teacher and offered to support him with money which he had obtained by improper means.

                落成当天，佛像开光，果舜来三缘寺请我去开光，我带领几个弟子，一同前去。当天晚间，来了十条龙（化人身），要求皈依三宝。这时初夏时节，天旱无雨，禾苗枯黄，靠天吃饭的农人，垂头丧气叹命苦，有时无语问苍天，祈祷老天爷：“可怜吧！慈悲吧！降点甘露吧！”我对众龙说：“你们的工作是行雨，天这样干旱，为什么不降雨呢？”</td>

That night ten dragons (manifesting in human form) came and requested to take refuge with the Triple Jewel. It was early summer, and there was a drought. The grain sprouts were parched, and the farmers were in very low spirits, for they depended on the rain. Sometimes they silently prayed to Heaven for rain. I told the dragons,
				“It’s your job to make the rain fall. Why has it been so dry?
				Why don’t you let it rain?” </p>

Then he lit a fire and burned himself to ashes. The next day, the villagers saw that Dragon Rain Cottage had been burned and went to see what had happened. Although Guo Shun’s body had been burned black, his heart was still intact and unburnt. Everyone was amazed, and they buried Guo Shun’s ashes and his heart there. </p>
