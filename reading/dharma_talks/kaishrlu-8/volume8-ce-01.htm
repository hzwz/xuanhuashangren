                In Manchuria, south of the city of Harbin, in the village Da-nan-gou there lived a filial son called Defu Gao. His mother was sick and none of the Chinese or Western doctors could cure her. In order to save his mother he vowed to cut off his hand and offer it to the Buddha. His filial act moved heaven and earth, and his mother was rescued from the clutches of death. This event caused quite a stir at the time. Even women and children knew that Gao was a greatly filial son. The story goes like this:</td>

			他母亲患重病，粒米不食，滴水不饮，奄奄一息，命在旦夕。于是他到三缘寺（这天是浴佛节，正举行大法会，参加的善信约有数百人），在佛前上香，三拜之后，拿出菜刀正要剁左手的时候，被人发现了，实时制止他，有人就问他：“为什么要剁手呢？”他说：“为了母亲的病，所以发心剁手供养佛。”当时有位居士，名叫李景华，对他说：“你快到方丈室去，求方丈和尚，他有神通，可能可以救你母亲。”</td>

Gao went to Three Conditions Mona&not;stery (it happened to be Shakyamuni Buddha’s birthday, so there was a big Dharma assembly going on, with a few hundred Buddhists attending) and lit a stick of incense in front of the Buddha. After three bows, he took out a kitchen knife and was just about to chop off his left hand, when he was discovered and stopped by some people. When asked why he wanted to cut off his hand, he explained that he’d vowed to chop off his hand and offer it to the Buddha because of his mother’s illness. At that time a layperson called Jinghua Li said to him,
				“Go to the Abbot’s office and plead with him. He has spiritual
				powers. Maybe he can save your mother.”</td>

“Why don’t you go ask Dharma Master An Ci. He can cure your mother’s illness.” So he came to my room asking me to be compassionate and attend to his mother’s illness. I had heard he was a filial son, so I promised to help him. I said to him,
“Ride your bike home first. I’ll be there right away.” He left happily. Since he was riding a bike, he had to go by the main road, while I took a shortcut. I arrived there ten minutes before him.</td>

This was a typical case of people who usually never lit incense, but were seeking help from the Buddha in an emergency. I wrote a declaration vowing that his mother would get well. After the declaration was burned, the mother fell asleep peacefully. Everyone went to bed. </td>

Quickly he cooked some porridge for her. She ate a bowl of porridge and regained enough strength to talk. (For eight days she hadn’t been able to talk, eat or drink. Her lips were parched and her tongue had turned black.)
