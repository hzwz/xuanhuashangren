                          现在是打禅七（一九七七年十二月十五日）的时间，诸位时时刻刻要提起话头，去参禅，去用功。修道人要自己修行，不要依赖他人，更不要依赖师父。我们是打禅七，不是打师父七，这一点要弄清楚。有人这样想：“师父在万佛圣城的时候，我就用功修行；师父离开万佛圣城，我就不认真修行。”这种思想，实在要不得。无论师父在不在万佛圣城，都要勇猛精进地修行，贯彻始终，才有成就。否则尽做表面的工作，那是自欺欺人的行为，永远得不到解脱。

Now we are holding a Chan Session (December 15, 1977), and you should all be bringing up your meditation topic at every moment, as you investigate Chan and work at meditation. Cultivators of the Way practice on their own; they do not rely on other people, and even less should they rely on their teacher. We are holding a meditation retreat, not a "Teacher-retreat." Please be clear about this point. Someone is thinking: "The Venerable Master is here now at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, so I'll take my cultivation seriously. Once he leaves, however, I won't have to cultivate hard anymore." You should not think this way. Whether or not your teacher is at the City, you should cultivate with vigor. Finish what you've started, applying yourself with equal energy all the way through; only then can you succeed. Otherwise your work will always be superficial; you'll only be fooling yourself and fooling others, and you'll never get liberated.

				参话头就是参“念佛是谁？”念佛是谁？这要参是哪一个？说是：“我在念佛。”那么我死了，这个“我”又跑到什么地方去？根本那不是“我”。这样说来，那是没有“我”了。既然没有“我”，那么还活着的时候，就不需要修行了？这是不正确的想法。应该怎样呢？就是要参本来的面目，父母未生以前的面目是什么样子？参明白了，就可开悟。

                <p class="commentary4">Investigating the meditation topic means asking, "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" Look into it! Who is it? If you say, "I'm reciting!" then after you die, where has that "I" gone to? In fact, the reciter isn't "I" after all. As we investigate it, there is no "I" to be found. Since there's no "I," then while I'm still alive, there's no need to cultivate, is there? This is a case of incorrect thinking. How should we think then? We should investigate our basic identity. Who were we before our parents bore us? What did we look like then? When you understand the answer to that question, you can get enlightened.

				念佛是哪一个？时时刻刻在追究，分分秒秒不放松。其实用这种功夫，就是以毒攻毒的方法。念佛是谁？虽然也是一个念，但是用一念控制一切念，用这个妄想停止一切妄想。制止到了极点的时候，水落石出，真相大白，便能开悟。

In fact, this technique is a way to use poison to counteract poison. Although the question, "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" is also a thought, we use one thought to control all other thoughts. One idle thought puts a stop to all idle thoughts. When those thoughts have been brought to an ultimate end, "the tide recedes and the rocks show through." We clearly perceive the true appearance of things, and then we can get enlightened.

This is called "a response in the Way." Because they've been bowing and reciting sincerely, they've moved the gods, dragons, and the rest of the eight divisions to stay constantly at their side. Therefore, no matter what trouble comes up, it always turns out smoothly. We should take their example to reflect upon ourselves: has this happened to us? We should reflect within to see if we have this kind of purity, light, wisdom, and lack of idle thinking.

Rely on yourself instead! As it's said, "The teacher leads you to the door, but cultivation depends on the individual." You should trust in your own wisdom, not your own stupidity. This is a very important distinction! The purpose of holding a meditation retreat is to let your nature take itself across. The Great Master the Sixth Patriarch once said,

                我们现在参禅，应该分秒必争，不可把宝贵的时光空过。所以在打禅七的时间，佛也不拜，过堂也不念供。为什么？就是给大家专一用功的机会。多一分钟参禅，便多一分钟开悟。哪有时间去打闲岔、去充壳子、去开小会？若三三五五，讲是讲非，讲些无意义的话，把开悟的时光轻易放过，尚不自知，这样参禅，就是参八万大劫，也没有希望。在打禅七的期间，一定要老老实实去参！参“念佛是谁？”参“父母未生以前的本来面目？”这是开智慧的钥匙。

Thus, when we hold our Chan Session, we neither bow to the Buddhas nor perform the meal offering ceremony. Why not? It's to give everyone a chance to concentrate single-mindedly on his meditation. One minute longer of meditation brings one minute more of enlightenment. Who can find time to interrupt the work, or to shoot the breeze, or to gather a small meeting? If you stand around shooting the bull, gossiping over trivia, talking lots of nonsense, then you'll carelessly waste time in which you could be getting enlightened, and you won't even realize it. Meditating in this way, you can investigate for 80,000 great eons, but you have no hope of success. While holding a retreat, you certainly must do honest work and really look into the matter. Which matter? Investigate, "Who is mindful of the Buddha?" Investigate, "What was my basic identity before my parents gave birth to me?" These are the keys to enlightenment.
