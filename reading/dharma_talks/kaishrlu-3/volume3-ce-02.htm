                        我们天天念观世音菩萨，可是观世音菩萨是什么意思呢？“观”是观察世间所有的声音。观也是看，但不是向外看，而是看众生的心，看哪一位众生的心没有妄想，空了，就得到开悟。所以说“十方同聚会，皆共学无为。”十方的善男信女聚集在一起，共同修无为法。念观世音菩萨，也是一种无为法，无为而无不为。这种无为法，就是叫你不要打妄想。

                Every day, we recite Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's name. But what does "Guanshiyin Bodhisattva" mean? "Guan" means "to contemplate," to contemplate all the sounds in the world. To contemplate also means to look. But it doesn't mean looking at things outside; it means looking into the minds of living beings. It's looking to see which living being is free of random thoughts. Once those thoughts are gone and the mind is empty, then one can become enlightened. Therefore, a line of verse states: "People have gathered from the ten directions to study the unconditioned." All of the good men and good women who've come together in this assembly from the ten directions are cultivating "unconditioned dharmas." Reciting the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva is also an unconditioned dharma. Being unconditioned means "there is nothing done and yet there is nothing left undone." This unconditioned dharma is a method for helping us get rid of random thoughts.

When did this time begin? What time am I talking about? I'm talking about a time that began with Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha Buddha is the Teaching Host in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss. He is Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's teacher, and Guanshiyin Bodhisattva helps Amitabha
				Buddha to propagate the Pure Land Dharma-door.

Not only does Guanyin Bodhisattva regard us as his younger brothers, he treats all living beings as his younger brothers. Otherwise, why would he listen to our sounds and come rescue us from our suffering? When we living beings get ourselves into trouble, why would Guanshiyin Bodhisattva want to help us out? It's because he sees that all living beings are just the same as his own hands and feet, his own flesh and bones. For this reason, Guanyin Bodhisattva fears neither trouble nor difficulty, and comes to rescue all the living beings who are suffering here in this Saha World. Therefore, none of us should forget our Dharma-brother. When we mindfully recite "Namo Guanshiyin Bodhisattva" one time, Guanyin Bodhisattva is also mindful of us.

We should recite the name of our Dharma-brother as sincerely as we can. Don't miss this chance! But as we recite the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, we shouldn't let our heads droop down. We should lift our heads up and recite with courageous, heroic vigor. Don't appear listless or apathetic. When Guanshiyin Bodhisattva sees our spirit, he'll say to us, "Quickly take my hand!" Then he'll take us toward the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss.

You should know that your looking and Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's looking aren't the same. Guanshiyin Bodhisattva looks inside, but you look outside. Guan-shiyin Bodhisattva looks at his own nature. He has every living being on his radar screen. Guanshiyin Bodhisattva knows all the idle thoughts that living beings are indulging in. Guanshiyin is always looking at his inner radar. Therefore, the things he looks at and the things you look at are not the same. Because some living beings are far away from him, even a thousand hands and a thousand eyes are not enough. He wants to look at limitless numbers of living beings, but he cannot see them all. For this reason he "reverses the light to reflect within." He turns his hearing back and listens to his own nature. He looks at the living beings of his self-nature. He wants to know the pain and suffering they are experiencing, then he goes to save those living beings. On the other hand, you are looking outside, forgetting all about your inherent wisdom. That's why I said your looking and his looking are different.

                我们天天念观世音菩萨，拜观世音菩萨；可是观世音菩萨现身在你面前，你又不认识，所以我们众生是很苦恼的。什么是观世音菩萨现身在你的面前，你也不认识呢？就是那个当面关，也就是你的考验。你念观世音菩萨，要学观世音菩萨的样子。观世音菩萨是大慈、大悲、大愿、大力，我们念观世音菩萨，也要学他的大慈、大悲、大愿、大力。无论谁对我们不好，我们都应该不动心。

That's why I say we living beings are extremely pitiable. What do I mean that if Guanshiyin Bodhisattva appeared in person before us, we wouldn't recognize him? It's our big test. When we recite Guanshiyin Bodhi-sattva's name, we should learn to be like him. Guanshiyin Bodhi-sattva possesses great kindness, great compassion, great vows, and great strength. When we recite his name, we should also learn to have his great kindness, great compassion, great vows, and great strength. No matter who mistreats us, our minds must remain calm.

Even if someone were to kill us, we should also bear it patiently, and recognize it as our rightful due. Why should we see it as our due? Because if we hadn't scolded others in the past, others wouldn't curse at us now. If we hadn't hit someone in the past, he certainly wouldn't come to beat us now. Why would someone want to curse at us, hit us, or kill us? Because in the past, when we were stupid and ignorant, we cursed at him, beat him, or killed him. So in this present life, the same situation has happened to us, and we should repay the debts that we accrued in the past. In the past, out of ignorance, we didn't make good our debts. Now that we understand, we should honestly acknowledge the unpaid debts. Once our debts are paid, we can see Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, and we can truly count as one of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's Dharma-relatives.

If we're always looking at the faults of others, it proves that our own suffering hasn't come to an end. We haven't pulled up the roots of suffering. So all of us must clearly recognize the situations that occur. We must thoroughly understand the Dharma. People who study the Buddhadharma have to be able to use the Buddhadharma. If we cannot use it, then no matter how long we cultivate, the Buddhadharma merely remains Buddhadharma, and we are simply us. But if we know how to use it, then we can become one with it; we become indivisibly united with the Buddhadharma.

                <p class="commentary4">Patience is of utmost importance; you must endure the things that you ordinarily find unendurable. For instance, maybe you don't want to put up with a scolding, but if someone scolds you, you should be happy about it. Perhaps you don't want to be beaten, but if someone beats you, you should be even happier. Perhaps you don't wish to die, because life is very precious. However, if someone wants to kill you, you should think, "This death can deliver me from the karmic obstacles of this life. He is truly my  wise teacher." So all of you should appreciate the Buddhadharma from the opposite side; learn to flip it over. Cultivating the Way is, in fact, cultivating from the reverse. How do we flip it over? It is simply a matter of learning to like what you dislike. You shouldn't, however, pass on to other people the things that you don't like.

As we study Buddhism, we shouldn't go looking for its truths in lofty and profound places. There is a saying, "The ordinary mind is the Way; the straight mind is the place of cultivation." We should have a straightforward attitude as we cultivate the Way.

When we recite Guanshiyin Bodhi-sattva's name, we should sweep away all such dirty thoughts. Purge thoughts of greed, anger, and stupidity. For example, we should pay no attention to whether the clothes we wear are pretty or not. If they protect us from the cold, that's enough. We shouldn't view our daily food like a gourmet who loves delicacies. If you have such vain thoughts, then you haven't recited Guanyin Bodhisattva's name with a true mind. If you held Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's name with a true mind, how could you possibly care about eating tasty food or wearing pretty clothes? You would've forgotten all that long ago. The only way to become one with Guanshiyin Bodhisattva is to forget everything else.

Guanshiyin Bodhisattva doesn't think, "Today I'll wear some pretty clothes, eat some delicious food, or enjoy some special offerings." He has no attachments and seeks nothing whatsoever. What he does is rescue living beings. He wants all living beings to leave suffering, attain bliss, end their birth and death, and accom-plish Buddhahood, yet he seeks nothing from living beings. He hopes that living beings will be able to truly understand the Buddhadharma and become free of greed, anger, and stupidity.
