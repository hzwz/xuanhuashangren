                When Buddhism spread to China, it developed into the Five Schools: the Chan School, the Teachings School, the Vinaya School, the Pure Land School, and the Secret School. The Chan School investigates Chan samadhi (meditative concentration); the Teachings School studies the doctrines; the Vinaya School studies the moral precepts; the Pure Land School practices Buddha recitation; and the Secret School recites mantras. We are now holding a Chan session, so for the time being, we discuss only the principles of Chan meditation and not the other four schools.

				禅那，译为“思惟修”，就是常想这件事。什么事？就是话头。研究“念佛是谁？”这句话，这叫参禅。其实参话头也是妄想，不过这是以妄制妄，以毒攻毒的办法，用一个妄想来消灭多个妄想。参话头的功夫，需要经过长时间才能有所成就，所谓“久参有禅”。

                <p class="commentary4">Chan translates as "thought-cultivation," because one is always contemplating the matter of meditation. What matter is that? It is simply the meditation topic one is investigating. We look into the question, "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" This single sentence is the topic in our investigation of Chan. In fact, investigating this topic is another kind of idle thinking. This method is known as "fighting fire with fire." We set one idle thought in action to wipe out many idle thoughts. To reach success with this method, we must work at it for a long time. A saying goes, "After long-term cultivation, there will be Chan."

				“参”好像用锥子来锥木头一样，不透不停止，不可半途而废，否则就前功尽弃了。参禅，第一要忍耐，忍耐到最高峰，就能一念不生。一念不生，就能开悟，所谓“百尺竿头，更进一步”，在百尺竿头上，再向前迈进一步，这时十方世界现全身。可是这个法门，要念兹在兹才有效，不能放松，不能放逸。在《证道歌》上说：
		<p class="style2">
        顿觉了，如来禅，<br>
        六度万行体中圆；<br>
        梦里明明有六趣，<br>

                <p class="commentary4">"Investigation" is similar to drilling wood: you don't stop until the drill bit makes a hole all the way through the wood. If you stop halfway, then your earlier efforts will all have been in vain. The first priority in Chan meditation is patience. When you can be patient to the extreme point, then you can reach a state of "not even one thought arising." When not even one thought arises, you can get enlightened. As the saying goes, "Take one more step from the top of the hundred-foot pole." At that time, when you can take yet another step from the very top of a hundred-foot pole, "the worlds throughout the ten directions manifest in their entirety." To gain success, however, you must apply yourself constantly, in thought after thought, without any laziness or slacking off. A verse in the <em>Song of Enlightenment</em> says:
				<p class="style1"><em>
When you suddenly awaken to the Chan of the Tathagatas,
Then the Six Paramitas and the Myriad Practices
    are complete within your substance.<br>
In a dream, very clearly, you perceive all the
   Six Realms of Rebirth.<br>
When you awaken, then you see all as empty and void,
   and not one bit of the universe exists at all. </em>

                顿，就是立刻觉悟一个理，所谓“理可顿悟，事须渐修。”在“事”上要一步一步修，在“理”上要立刻就明白。顿悟的时候，知道井在那里，可以去取水。没有顿悟的时候，常听辘轳（汲水的工具）响，但不知井在何处？这个譬喻，是说明佛性从什么地方来的？怎能证得佛性？证佛性别无二法，唯一的方法，就是参禅打坐。

                <p class="commentary4">"Suddenly" here means that you immediately understand a principle. As it's said, "We may awaken to the truth of a principle suddenly, but we must cultivate the specifics gradually." The specifics must be cultivated one step at a time, yet the principle may be awakened to all of a sudden. For instance, after enlightenment, we know there is a well nearby from which we can draw water. Before our enlightenment, we may have heard the sound of the wellpulley and rope for a long time, and yet not have known where the well was located. This analogy explains where the Buddha-nature comes from. How do we realize this Buddha-nature? There is no other method to realize it: it can only be realized through Chan meditation.

                <p class="commentary4">Bodhisattvas use the Six Paramitas as their method of cultivation. They are: (1) giving, which takes stinginess across; (2) moral precepts, which take across transgressions; (3) patience, which takes across hatred; (4) vigor, which takes across laxness; (5) Chan concentration, which takes across scatteredness, and (6) wisdom, which takes across stupidity. Only when these Six Paramitas have been cultivated to perfection can one become enlightened.

Once we awaken, however, and get enlightened, then the entire trichiliocosm no longer exists. Why not? Because we are no longer attached to it. When we are no longer attached, then all the myriad creatures in existence completely return to their origin. How could any further trace of self exist?  How could any traces of others, of living beings, or of a life span remain? None of these exist any longer. Some people, after they learn that the four traces can be made to disappear, won't dare cultivate any longer. They get upset at the idea of there being no more people, living beings, or life spans. They exclaim, "If there is no more work left to do, I will be out of a job!"

Even though Guanshiyin Bodhisattva is right before our eyes, we still go running all over looking for him elsewhere; thus we are controlled by our upside-down, idle thinking.

                <p class="commentary4">The word "investigation" in the phrase "investigating Chan" means "to contemplate." What is there to contemplate? We use  contemplative Prajna. This means to contemplate our own presence in thought after thought. It does not mean to contemplate others' presence. We should contemplate whether or not we are fully here. If we are, then we have the ability to investigate Chan and meditate, and we can use our skill in cultivation. But if we are not here, and are indulging in idle thoughts instead, our mind scatters to the wind. Then even though our body may be present in the Chan hall, our mind has run off to New York for a bit of sight-seeing, or perhaps run off to Rome for a holiday. Our mind has gone out to climb the social ladder, so, as a result, we lack self-presence; we are "not here."

But if we can contemplate with self-presence without our thoughts running away, then we can practice the profound Prajna Paramita.

Only this counts as "practicing the profound Prajna Paramita" and finding wisdom. Only after we have attained great wisdom can we really reach the other shore.

                五蕴本来没有自性，犹如空中的浮云，自然而有，自然而无。不明白这个道理，就被五蕴所覆，不得自在，不得解脱。我们修道，就是破五蕴，好像浮云，来，随它来；去，随它去，不需要注意它，不需要

                <p class="commentary4">The Five Aggregates, in fact, have no nature of their own, just like clouds floating in space. Very spontaneously they appear, and spontaneously they disappear. If we fail to understand this principle and let ourselves be covered over by the Aggregates, we will be neither free nor liberated. We should be skillful in cultivation, so that when the Five Aggregates arise, we can break through them. When they come, they come on their own, and when they go, they are free to leave on their own. We need not pay attention to them. Nor do we need to attach to them. Greed, anger, and stupidity are just like bubbles of foam on the water; they basically have no real substance. Born of themselves, they vanish of themselves; and if we don't attach to them, they cease to exist. The <em>Song of Enlightenment</em> by Great Master Yongjia also says,
   				<p class="style1">
Realize Ultimate Reality, and people and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dharmas
    no longer exist. <br>
In that instant we eradicate the karma of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Relentless Hells. <br>

                <p class="commentary4">As we sit in the Chan hall, we must actually go and cultivate. Our work is just like reeling silk off a cocoon. We must be patient and proceed gradually. Only then can we avoid tangling the thread. We may not try to get clever and invent shortcuts, nor use a scientific, improved method to get enlightened. That amounts to mere idle thinking. If science could bring us enlightenment, then the scientists would not forever be painting themselves into corners, but would long ago have become enlightened; and nobody else after that would ever get a chance at it! We needn't build castles in the air, but need only follow the tried-and-true procedures: cultivate hard and look into "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" Be patient when your back aches and your legs hurt. When your patience has reached maturity, you will spontaneously become enlightened. A saying goes,

Know that each bit of work yields a bit of skill. Cultivation requires true skill, not mere lip service. To be able to talk about cultivation without really being able to do it is useless. Paying lip service not only does not advance your enlightenment, it becomes an obstruction instead. Thus a saying goes, "Only in silence is it actually Chan."
