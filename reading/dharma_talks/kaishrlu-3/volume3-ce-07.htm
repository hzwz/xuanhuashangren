                The Dharma-door of Chan meditation points directly to the human mind. It teaches us to see our nature and to become a Buddha. It is also called "the sudden teaching." The teaching of sudden enlightenment is brought to success by cultivating the gradual teaching. There's a saying that goes: "One may suddenly be enlightened to the principles, but then one puts the principles into practice gradually." Now in our daily deportment, as we walk, sit, stand, and lie down, we are cultivating gradually. Then in the future, there will be a day when we truly understand and we suddenly get enlightened. That's what we mean by sudden. The sudden, in fact, is not apart from the gradual; and the gradual also aids the sudden.

If it weren't the number one dharma, then they wouldn't want to cultivate it, and they'd have no interest in cultivating. However, if you truly understand, then all dharmas are also the Buddhadharma. But none of them can be attained, so there's absolutely nothing for us to be attached to.

				打禅七，是调身调心。调身，令身不乱动。调心，令心不打妄想，常常清净；心能常清净，则尽虚空遍法界都在自性里边。自性是无所不包，无所不容，也就是本来的佛性。

                <p class="commentary4"> When we hold a Chan session, we are taming our bodies and regulating our minds. Taming the body keeps it from acting in random, impulsive ways. Regulating the mind means not allowing it to indulge in idle thoughts, so it's always pure and clear. Then no matter where we go, to the ends of space or the limits of the Dharma Realm, we're still right within our self-nature. Our inherent nature contains absolutely everything. Nothing falls outside of it. It's just our fundamental Buddha-nature.

A session is a period of time set aside for seeking realization. During this special period, we are determined to gain benefit. We must certainly apply effort and seek understanding.

在禅堂里，要用功修行，少说废话，不要浪费时间。所谓“一寸光阴一寸金，寸金难买寸光阴。”坐禅确实是这样宝贵，不知在哪一分钟就能开悟，所以要分秒必争，任何时间也不能放过。若是到厕所，方便之后，即刻回到禅堂，继续打坐；到斋堂去，吃完饭之后，立刻回到禅堂打坐；喝完茶之后，即刻回到禅堂打坐。总而言之，不放弃开悟的机会。不知哪个时候，就是开悟的时候；换句话说，行香、跑香、坐香，都是开悟的良机，不可错过！

There's a saying that goes, "An instant of time is worth an ounce of gold; an ounce of gold cannot buy back an instant of time." That's just how valuable time is in Chan meditation. Who knows in which minute we'll become enlightened? So we have to cherish each and every moment, and not let any time casually slip by. If you go to the restroom, once you have finished your business, quickly return to the Chan hall and continue to sit. When you finish your meal, quickly come back to the Chan hall and sit. After you drink your tea, hurry back to the Chan hall and sit. In general, you shouldn't give up any chance to become enlightened. Who knows in which minute of the session your enlightenment will arrive? To say it another way, whether we are walking, running, or sitting in meditation, these are all good chances to get enlightened. Don't miss your chance!

                <p class="commentary4">Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty once summoned the Venerable Abbot of Gaomin Monastery, Chan Master Tianhui (Heavenly Wisdom), to Beijing. The emperor wanted to discuss the theory of Chan meditation with him and asked him if he understood the teaching of the National Master Yulin (Jade Forest). Chan Master Tianhui could not answer his question. The emperor thereupon confined him in the Chan hall within the palace and told that him within seven days he must come up with the answer, or else forfeit his head. During the first six days, he couldn't hammer out an answer. But on the last day, he ran around the Chan hall in agitation, pacing back and forth until he was so dizzy that he banged right into a big pillar. A large bump sprang up on the side of his head. With that knock, his mind suddenly grew extremely clear, and he reached a very satisfactory answer. Then he went to see the Emperor Yongzheng, who knew that he had already understood the teaching of National Master Yulin and become enlightened. From that time onward, walking meditation became a standard practice in the Chan hall.

                <p class="commentary4">Our program in the Chan hall consists of walking meditation, running meditation, sitting meditation, and investigating the meditation topic. Walking meditation requires a brisk pace; running meditation is like jogging; sitting meditation is Chan-style sitting; and investigating a meditation topic means contemplating one sentence. For example, we may investigate "Who's mindful of the Buddha?" We must concentrate intently on that one question until our mind becomes completely focused. When no other thought mars our perfect concentration, we can become enlightened.

                <p class="commentary4">The method the patriarchs came up with was to fight fire with fire. We use a meditation topic (<em>hua-tou</em>) to control our idle thinking. That is to say, we use one question to counteract many questions. What meditation topic do we investigate? We ask, "Who is mindful of the Buddha?" or "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" When you figure out who it is, when you know ultimately who is there reciting the Buddha's name, then you'll genuinely understand. What do you understand? You understand that you should carefully avoid all inverted behavior and gossip. As it says in the Heart Sutra, "One leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind, and ultimately attains Nirvana." In this process you must endure a great deal of bitter toil before you can succeed. But if I were to say more, I'd be interrupting the flow of your work. So the best thing for all of you is to follow the rules, put your feet on solid ground, and work hard at cultivation.

No matter what you do, if you can concentrate single-mindedly, you'll certainly succeed at it. Investigating the meditation topic works the same way. The topic is the only thing we think about. We think about it by day and by night; we think about it as we eat and as we sleep, as we walk, and as we sit, to the point that we stop thinking about it only after the oceans dry up and the boulders crumble. To put it another way, as long as we're not enlightened, we don't dare to stop. To contemplate one question is true practice; to ponder many questions is simply idle thinking. There's a very interesting saying that goes,
				<p class="style1"><em>If one can sit perfectly still for even a split second, One's merit surpasses that of building pagodas of
  the seven gems in number like the Ganges' sands.</em>

If we fail to find a way to avert the impending crisis, before long the entire planet will surely explode. Why would the planet explode? It's because science has run amok with its heedless progress. Great nations invent missiles and weapons with ever-quickening strides; nations compete with each other in building nuclear weapons, laser-cannons, and so forth. If war were to break out, these weapons would blow the world to bits. When that takes place, we'll really have reached doomsday.

Take a look at the many strange diseases that proliferate nowadays, which doctors have no way to cure. Such diseases occur because the atmosphere has been polluted, fouled by poisonous vapors everywhere. We cultivators of the spiritual path should use a kind of electrotherapy to detoxify the air. What is electrotherapy? It means sitting in meditation and emitting a light of wisdom from our meditative state. This light of wisdom is a form of electricity; when these waves of electricity pass through the air, they have the effect of detoxifying it. They transform the contaminated air into clean air. This is what we mean by using electrotherapy to heal the illnesses of the world.

A matched couplet talked about their partnership:

                现在的空气为什么会污浊呢？因为一般人不知道修行，不会使用电疗，所以空气越来越污浊。我们修道人要负起责任，使空气清洁。不但自己要勇猛精进地坐禅，还要劝亲戚朋友来坐禅。坐禅的功德是无量无边，对身心有不可思议的好处，如果他们不相信的话，教他们试一试，不久即可得到不可思议的好处。大家努力坐禅，毫光照大千，空气的毒素，自然被消灭了。

                <p class="commentary4">Why is the air polluted now? Because most people do not know about cultivation, and they do not how to use this electrotherapy method. Therefore, the air becomes more polluted and more fouled every day. We cultivators should shoulder the responsibility of purifying the air. Not only should you yourself be courageous and vigorous as you meditate, but you should encourage your relatives and friends to meditate, too. The merit and virtue of meditation is measureless and boundless. It helps the body and mind in inconceiv-able ways. If they don't believe what you say, then tell them to try it out, and before long, they'll also experience these inconceivable benefits. All of you should work hard and meditate well! Let the light of your hair-mark radiate throughout the universe, so that the toxins in the air will be spontaneously eliminated.
