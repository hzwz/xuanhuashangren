				在佛和菩萨的境界上，没有苦恼，也没有快乐，苦乐俱忘。众生多数是颠倒，以是为非，以非为是；将黑作白，将白作黑。究竟他知不知道这是颠倒呢？知道的。虽然他知道，他仍然去做不对的事；明明知道不合法，可是他专门去做；知道什么是对的，他却不去做。

Most of us living beings are inverted. We take right for wrong, and see wrong as right. We turn black into white and white into black. And yet, are we aware that this is inverted behavior? On the one hand, you might say we do know. But even though we know, we still insist on doing wrong things. We clearly know that something is not in accord with Dharma, yet we do these deeds more often than not. We know what's right, but we cannot bring ourselves to do it.

There's a special time reserved for drinking tea; people can't drink whenever they feel like it. A person who drinks tea when it's time to recite the Buddha's name is just being lazy. He gets tired reciting the Buddha's name, so he decides to take a rest and help himself to a cup of tea. If someone is reciting the Buddha's name true-heartedly, how could he possibly think of drinking tea? He'd have forgotten about drinking tea altogether. Even less would he think of drinking milk. He'd have forgotten everything else. When a person is truly reciting the Buddha's name, he's not aware of whether or not he's eaten. Even less would he think of drinking a cup of tea.

Nonetheless, this "not knowing" reveals true skill. Someone who understands cultivation isn't aware of whether or not he's eaten, gotten dressed, or slept. He's forgotten everything. He doesn't know if it's day or night. He is not aware of the heaven above, the earth below, or the people in between. Everything is empty. Everything being empty, how could he possibly think of drinking tea or milk?

So he doesn't dare to drink it. We should eat only enough to sustain our life. We should take food as medicine, taking a bit to sustain ourselves because if we didn't eat, we'd die. However, there's no need to eat very nutritious food to bolster our body. If we eat excessively nutritious food, we'll have a lot of trouble. When we cultivate the Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name, we should be constantly mindful of the phrase, "Namo Amitabha Buddha," and never stop reciting it. We recite the name both when we are awake and when we are asleep. We recite this eight-syllable great name "Namo Amitabha Buddha" continuously, until our recitation cannot be cut even with a sword, and the power of our recitation is even more solid than a diamond. Then there is no way to interrupt our recitation of "Namo Amitabha Buddha." This state is known as the Buddha Recitation Samadhi.

In this state, we cannot indulge in idle thinking even if we want to. Cultivation is really not easy. Take a look at Guo Zhen (Master Heng Sure, who cultivates "three steps, one bow.") Why did he make a vow not to drink milk? Because he knows how harmful milk is. As soon as he drinks milk, a bovine nature appears, and this bovine nature is more fearsome than a tiger.

修行，要把它看作各人的本分，不需要贪，久而久之，功德自会圆满，菩提果也会成就。本来应该成功的，贪多却嚼不烂，吃饭要一口一口吃，把一碗饭统统塞到嘴里去，挤得口里一点地方也没有，你说这怎样吃？嚼也嚼不动，更咽不下去。吃饭是最简单的比喻。这叫“贪多嚼不烂”。

Over time, our merit and virtue will naturally be perfected, and we'll accomplish the fruition of Bodhi. It may be that we were due to accomplish it, but then we bit off more than we could chew. We must eat one mouthful at a time. If we try to stuff too much food into our mouth at once, leaving no room for chewing, how can we eat it? We can neither chew nor swallow it. Eating is a very simple analogy. This is called "biting off more than you can chew."

Can I get spiritual powers?" Who could expect results so quickly? A farmer plants the seeds in the ground and waits patiently until they sprout. When the time is right, they will ripen by themselves. The ancients had a saying, "Rub an iron pillar down to the size of a sewing needle. When your spiritual skill is mature, you will naturally succeed." You should not fear that you might be wasting effort. Over time, you will naturally rub the iron pillar down to the size of a needle.

                所以修道，就要去毛病。什么是毛病？你欢喜喝茶，这是毛病；欢喜喝牛奶，这是毛病；欢喜打妄想，也是毛病。如果你一切贪图自在，用功便不相应。用功，是不怕苦、不怕难、不怕疲倦，才会有成就。在这里要向你们诸位道歉，因为我欢喜说笑话，所以你们胖的人，听我说了以后，不要急着去减肥。要不然又变成头上安头，弄出很多麻烦来。

Liking to entertain idle thoughts is a fault. If you always crave comfort and ease, then your efforts will never evoke a response. If you don't fear suffering, difficulty or fatigue, you'll succeed in cultivation. Now I want to apologize to all of you here. You see, I like to joke around, so those of you who are overweight should not immediately go on a diet after listening to my advice on eating. If you do, you will be "adding a head on top of the head you already have," and causing yourself much vexation!

                <p class="commentary4">Calamities now fill the entire world. Our world has become a dark place without any light. The continued existence of humankind is seriously threatened. We are engulfed by a killing energy that has never existed before. We know about atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, nuclear weapons, and even laser-cannons. If one of these lethal weapons were set off, the entire human race could easily be wiped out. In the present time, a black miasma covers the entire world, and this karma of black deeds surrounds every land. The only way we can avert calamity is to cultivate according to the Buddhadharma.	 In any location where there are genuine cultivators, the disasters will be slightly lessened. If many, many cultivators could gather together and unite their efforts, they'd be able to eradicate disasters, invisibly transforming the violent energy into a positive, beneficial atmosphere. To make it happen, however, we must do real work, take firm strides, and honestly cultivate according to the Buddhadharma.

Why do I say this? Because the people at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas all wish to be good. Even if they entertain idle thoughts, those thoughts, by and large, are wholesome thoughts; rarely are they evil thoughts. So we can rightly say that the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas acts as both a sun and a moon for the world, shining everywhere on the globe, and bringing clarity and coolness to all people.

If one wants to find what's true, the first step is to put down what is false. It won't work to cultivate world-transcending dharmas on one hand, and still be unable to put down mundane dharmas on the other. Such a person has one foot in each boat. He wants to go to the northern bank and also to the southern bank of the river, but that's impossible.
