The Master's visit caused great excitement among the faithful laity.

There were some who originally knew nothing about Buddhism, but who, after hearing the Master's strong warnings concerning Taiwan's current situation, began engaging in earnest discussions on the positive and negative aspects of the situation.</td>

Seeing the Master's face filled with kindness, compassion, joy, and charity even after such a long and tiring journey, many disciples were moved to tears. The Master's purity in the practice of the precepts, samadhi, and wisdom had moved these people so deeply that, even at such a late hour, they still wanted to come and welcome the Master.</td>

Then, although the Master was seriously ill, he went to Amitabha Sagely Monastery in Hualien in order to fulfill the wishes of his disciples in eastern Taiwan. Despite his weariness, the Master travelled non-stop around the island, propagating the Dharma in order to give blessings to the people of Taiwan and hoping to diminish natural as well as man-made disasters.</td>

Liang Surong, the Supervisor of Presidential Affairs, who had begun to realize the impermanence of worldly affairs after seeing several of his colleagues die, also came to attend the ceremony. Among the thirty people who shaved their heads to become monks and nuns, there were two Indonesian-Chinese brothers named Lin who were only eleven and twelve years old. Having made vows to cross over living beings, they had their parents' permission to leave the home-life with the Venerable Master. It is truly due to their deep good roots from past lives and their ripening conditions that they have been able, at such a young age, to make such vows and leave the home-life to take on the heroic appearance of Sanghans.</td>

Even with such a tight and busy schedule, the Master still managed to meet a lot of visitors. Most of these visitors had made appointments with the Master even before he came to Taiwan. On the morning of January 9, the Master met and talked with Lin Yanggang, the Director of the Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China, and Liang Surong, the Supervisor of Presidental Affairs. Although the conversation was brief, every remark by the Master inspired deep reflection. For example: "The situation of Taiwan right now is similar to that of the Southern Song Dynasty in the Ling An period. The nation was confined to a small area, and everyone was fighting for fame and profit." "If a person with strong morals and great virtue leads the country, the country will prosper. When the country's downfall is imminent, bad signs will be seen." "In the political field we should not favor any one party; we should all work together." "The Six Principles of not fighting, not being greedy, not seeking, not being selfish, not pursuing personal advantage, and not lying are the best methods, but stupid people are not bold enough to apply them."</td>

Those who disagreed with the Master's viewpoint called the Master "a monk who interferes in politics." The Master remained unmoved by both praise and slander. Even the harshest denouncements failed to stir him to anger. Greatly concerned about the welfare of Taiwan's twenty million people, the Master said, "Actually I do not want to interfere in political affairs; it's just that I'm too concerned about Taiwan to remain silent."</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">On the afternoon of January 9, the Master went to a Dharma Master's dwelling to hold an "opening light" ceremony for the Buddha images. Hundreds of faithful laypeople, led by the members of the Cultivators' Association founded by that Dharma Master, filled the building. Businessmen and employees from nearby stores all took this opportunity to come to see the Master. The Dharma Master's former husband told the assembly of how the Venerable Master had saved her life from a serious sickness. A mother, Mrs. Du, in a choked voice, described how her daughter had been unconscious for forty-two days after a conflagration and how the Master rescued her from the hands of death. Huang Guoling, who came from Malaysia recounted how some ten years ago, she had been in real suffering when she discovered that her husband was having an affair. Fortunately, the Master had instructed her to recite Guanshiyin Bodhisattva's name, and by doing so she had obtained some responses that saved her family from breaking apart. Lastly, the Master said in a sincere but humorous tone, "All of you good men and good women with wisdom, don't listen to them talk about how I've cured their illnesses or what kind of responses they have gotten. That's just what they say. When I was young, wherever I went I would try to save people's lives. I was willing to give up my own life in order to cure someone else's illness. Later when I went to Hong Kong, I stopped curing people's illnesses because it was offending their karmic obstacle ghosts. People's illnesses are caused by their karmic obstacles, which are created not in one lifetime but over many lifetimes. When these karmic obstacle ghosts come to collect their debts from people, they are not reasonable at all. They are like the Communist Party, which insists on "sharing" your property regardless of whether or not the property belongs to you. If you wish to recover from your illness, you have to be sincere, for sincerity brings efficacy. If you are not sincere and you think you can just rely on me, it won't work."</td>

Reflecting on the luxurious lifestyle of many rich Taiwanese, the Master sighed and said, "You think their kind of life is enjoyable, but to me it's like being in hell." Truly, many of those who enjoy riches and abundance do not know how to cherish their blessings. Every day they lavish money on eating and drinking; they lead lives of pride, luxury, profligacy, and idleness, and they commit countless offenses.</td>

His answers were incisive and humorous, making the audience nod in agreement and sometimes burst into laughter. For example, one person asked, "How can one be reborn in the Pure Land?" The Master replied, "Why do you want to be reborn there? How can you get there when you are carrying so much garbage?" Another person asked, "How can I counteract improper thoughts? " The Master said, "Reflect within and ask yourself: hy can't I bring up proper thoughts, and why do I enjoy improper thoughts so much?'"</td>

Young people do not have much experience, and so they cannot accomplish much. Yet we can still appoint those who are truly talented. In ancient China, Gan Luo became Prime Minister when he was only twelve years old. Tai Gong remained loyal to and protective of King Wen even when he was eighty years old. Those who are headstrong and refuse to listen to others' advice will not be good for the country." Recently, physical force has frequently been used in political meetings at all levels of government. Regarding this, the Master said, "Those who constantly fight are not politicians. They are only sending the people to the hells and bringing calamities upon them."</td>

One disciple who couldn't bear to see the Master undergoing such toil said, "Master, you must be tired..." The Master smiled and said, "If I were to die of weariness, that would be okay. There's nothing to talk about." The Venerable Master, who has never complained of weariness, always aims toward his goal of "offering this deep resolve to the myriad Buddhas' lands, thus endeavoring to repay the Buddhas' boundless grace." For the sake of propagating the Buddhadharma, guiding those who are upright, and helping those who are good-hearted to succeed, the Master is willing to shed blood and sweat, never pausing to rest. The way that the Master worked from morning to night on January 11th was typical of the Master's entire stay in Taiwan. That day a strange thing happened. One disciple told the Master that a large forest fire had been burning for several days on Jade Mountain and requested the Master to mercifully rescue the numerous creatures that lived on the mountain. The Master simply told her not to care too much about this matter and didn't respond to her request directly. Strangely enough, however, frost began to fall on Jade Mountain that very night, and the great fire was completely extinguished.</td>

                  <p class="commentary">一月十七日，恰逢周日，法会现场台北县立体育馆大爆满，皈依受戒、受幽冥戒的人数近万人。这七天法会的主办人颇具动员组织能力，号召许多发心的居士义务协助，使法会进行得有条不紊，如法庄严，宣公上人亦感欣慰。这次受戒的人数众多，必将为台湾地区减少暴戾之气，增加祥和正气。有许多善信在上人即将结束访台行程时，才求见上人，希望上人能给他们传法、治病等等，不一而足。更多位依依不舍的信众，在上人搭机返美前，赶到华懋饭店送行。还有人是专程自南部上来，诚意可感。有鉴于许多善信这次未能如愿参加法会、皈依受戒，上人的弟子已计划邀请宣公上人，明年再来台湾访问，为渴慕的众生，传播正法之音。</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">On Sunday, January 17, the Taipei County Stadium was packed. Over ten thousand people came to receive the Three Refuges, the Five Precepts, and the Precepts for the Deceased [Bodhisattva Precepts]. The manager of the seven-day Dharma Assembly organized the whole event very capably, and with the help of the lay volunteers he had called together, the Dharma Assembly went smoothly and was very adorned, orderly, and in accord with Dharma. The Venerable Master was comforted by this. With the great number of people who received the precepts this time, the violent energy in Taiwan will certainly be decreased and turned into auspicious and proper energy. Many disciples came to see the Master at the very end of the Master's visit in Taiwan, hoping the Master would transmit the Dharma to them, cure their sicknesses, and so forth. More disciples came to Huamao Hotel right before the Master went to the airport, including those who specially made a trip from the south. Their sincerity was very moving. Since there are still many laypeople who were unable to participate in the Dharma Assembly and receive the precepts as they wished, the Master's disciples plan to invite the Master to come to Taiwan again next year to spread the sound of the proper Dharma to living beings who yearn to hear it.</td>
