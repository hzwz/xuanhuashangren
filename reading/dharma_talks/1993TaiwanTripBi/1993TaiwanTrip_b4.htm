Look at yourself, and see whether you are a Buddhist disciple who does not fight, is not greedy, does not seek, does not pursue personal gain, and does not tell lies. If you can practice these Six Great Principles, then you have more or less fulfilled your human role. Yet you are still far from Buddhahood, and you have to start from these Six Great Principles to become a Buddha. If you continue to fight, to be greedy, to seek for something, to be so selfish and self-benefitting, and to tell lies, not only are you not a disciple of the Buddha, you cannot even be considered the disciple of a ghost.</td>

For example, when you practice good deeds, you should do them in a genuine place, not in a phony place. In a genuine place, whether the good deeds you do are great or small, you will still obtain some merit and virtue. However, if you practice good deeds at a temple full of fighting, greed, seeking, selfishness, self-benefiting, and lying, it is all in vain, like a tree that blooms but bears no fruit. You should all recognize what is true. I'm not saying that the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is good in any way. There are left-home people at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas just like anywhere else. However, both the men and the women who have left the home-life there eat one meal a day. You won't find another place in the world like that.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">Furthermore, whether they are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, the left-home people at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas always wear their precept sash. They all have the requisites of three sashes, an almsbowl, and a sitting cloth, as prescribed by the precepts of Buddhism. Nowadays, people have unconsciously adopted the habit of not wearing their sash, so that those who don't wear their sash are considered authentic, while those who wear it are considered fake. Those who wear their sash are criticized by others as being strange, yet in the past the Buddha himself always wore his sash and owned three sashes, a bowl, and a sitting cloth. The Buddha's disciples did the same. When Buddhism spread to China, the sash alone was not warm enough in the colder climate, so they put on extra clothing underneath and wore the sash on the outside. Some say that there was no clasp and ring sewn on the sash in those days, and left-home people simply wrapped the sash around themselves in the same fashion that Theravada monks wear their robes now. They still wore the sash at all times. However, in China the left-home people had to farm and do a lot of other work to support themselves, and they found it inconvenient to wear the sash. As a result, they took off the sash when working, and only wore it when they were not working. After a while, they didn't wear the sash even when they were not working, and wearing the sash came to be considered incorrect. If you do not even understand this basic principle, you cannot be considered a Buddhist disciple.</td>

Because they were fleeing for their lives, none of the students, except maybe one or two, remembered to bring their diplomas. When they applied for college in Taiwan, they were at a loss when asked for their diplomas. So they searched everywhere to find a sample diploma. When they found a real one, they forged copies. They submitted the counterfeit diplomas to the Department of Education, and were then allowed to take the entrance exams and enroll in college. However, when someone submitted his authentic diploma to the Department of Education, they thought it was false. They said, "Everyone else's diploma is clean and well-kept. Why is yours all creased and torn up? You must have forged it and made it old and dirty-looking on purpose so that people wouldn't be able to tell." So they refused to accept it.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">All of you, think about this: The fake ones were considered real, and the real one was thought to be false. Now, left-home people everywhere do not wear their sash, thinking that is what left-home people should do. They just wear the robe with the arched collar. These robes were the standard dress of the Tang Dynasty. Both the left-home people and the laypeople wore these robes, and the left-home people wore sashes over them to distinguish themselves from the laypeople. Laypeople dress differently now, but left-home people still dress the same as before. The robe with the arched collar is the traditional dress of the Tang Dynasty and not the special attire of left-home people. If you are not even clear about questions of external appearance, how much less will you understand the underlying principle. There is no way you would see the true principle. Therefore, you students of Buddhism, don't take the false to be real. I am not claiming to be the real one. I may also be a phony, just putting on an act. However, even what is phony no longer exists. That is, people have unknowingly turned an incorrect practice into the custom.</td>

Although I am not against people who do not wear their sash, they do oppose those of us who wear our sash, which is very puzzling to me.</td>
