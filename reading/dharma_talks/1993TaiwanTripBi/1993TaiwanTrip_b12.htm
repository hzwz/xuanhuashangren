The precepts prevent evil. Each one of us should always "do no evil and practice all good." Don't break the rules. We should abide by the Dharma, the laws of the Buddha, as well as observe the laws of the nation.</td>

<p class="commentary4">The first is "Consider the amount of work." You should think about how much merit and virtue it takes to produce a single grain of rice. Therefore the ancients said, "A single grain of the donor's rice is as heavy as Mount Sumeru. If you eat it and fail to attain the Way, you will have to repay it with fur and horns." Since it takes a long period of cultivation before the Way is attained, I changed one word, so that the verse reads, "A single grain of the donor's rice is as heavy as Mount Sumeru. If you eat it and fail to cultivate the Way..." Let's not talk about attaining the Way. It's enough if you cultivate the Way. But if you don't cultivate, "you will have to repay it with fur and horns."</td>

When we think of the farmer's sweat and toil to grow even one grain of rice, if we fail to be grateful for all his work, then we have no conscience. We must appreciate the farmer's work which makes it possible for us to have food to eat. Do you know that every grain of rice in your plate came only after a lot of hard work?

<p class="commentary4">Third, we must prevent ourselves from being greedy when we eat. Ah! If something tastes good, we eat more of it, and if it doesn't taste good, we eat less of it. We are not at all impartial about it. We should be impartial and not be greedy for good-tasting food. I am a left-home person who has not been greedy for good food even since when I was still a layperson. I eat only the things that other people don't want to eat, and I try to avoid eating the food that others like to eat. This is really foolish. Most people think it's a good thing to eat good food which is nutritious for the body. When they eat plain food, they think it has no nutrition. That's not the way I am. You may say I'm just trying to act special, but that's not the case. It's just that I don't want to be choosy about what I eat. Avoiding greed--that's my principle in taking food.</td>

I started eating three bowls of food at each meal and taking only one meal a day. Now I don't even eat three bowlfuls. At the most I eat two bowls, or sometimes just one bowl. I don't know why, but my stomach cannot hold that much, and if I eat too much, I feel very uncomfortable and my random thoughts start flying about wildly.</td>

Because you are doing a ceremony, and you should do it with utmost sincerity. Don't let your mind wander off. It shouldn't be that whenever someone walks by you, you know who it is.

If you have food to eat and you make me watch you eat, that's not very considerate. However, Buddhists should be able to endure cold, thirst, and hunger; in everything we do, we should be in accord with the Buddhadharma. We shouldn't crave good things to eat, fancy clothes to wear, or a nice place to live. We shouldn't crave comfort. If we endure suffering, we will put an end to suffering. If we enjoy blessings, we will exhaust our blessings.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">The newspapers say that I am aggressive and charismatic. All of you should avoid being taken in by my superstitious image. Don't listen to those people who say that I have spiritual powers! I'll be frank with you--I don't even have ghostly powers! Don't listen to those rumors. You should have the ability to truly recognize the Dharma. I don't know how to cure people who are sick. I don't have any ability at all. "My mind is truly laughable. It is dull and ignorant. People ask what it can do: It has no ability whatsoever." I don't know how to do anything. I'm stupid to the extreme. I don't understand anything. I'm not being polite; it's true. You shouldn't think I'm being polite. I've never been capable of polite courtesies. I am really the most stupid and dull-witted person. Why is that? The things that I do are what no one else is willing to do. The things I say are what no one else dares to say. Why don't they dare to say them? They're afraid of hurting people's feelings and offending people. I'm just a stubborn living being who likes to say stubborn words. I'll tell you honestly, even though the temperature fell to three or four degrees below freezing during the winters in Manchuria, I stubbornly showed my superiority by wearing the same three layers of clothing and eating only one meal a day in the winter as well as the summer. If I weren't such an obstinate person, how could I have taken such a loss? How could I have been willing to endure the hunger and cold? I have just explained the principle for you. Whether you believe it or not, that's what I say. I hope all of you will take losses more often and not seek so many bargains. Don't be a snake oil salesman.<br>
