That's because if I am not beating people, then I am scolding people. So I want to inform you in advance. Now I want every one of you to close your eyes. If you are sincere, you will get a response. All of you have come here with a motive, a hope. What are you hoping for? I know you all hope that I will give you aid. If you want aid, you must first be sincere and true. Don't just go through the motions and try to get by. What is sincerity? Now if I were to strike each of you three times with my cane, I probably wouldn't be finished even after several hours. So, I will strike each of you from here. You may feel it when you get struck. You may feel the pain, or you may not feel it. You may have some kind of sensation. For those who feel something, that doesn't mean you have received aid. If you don't feel anything, that's just your own response; you haven't really understood the Buddhas' principles yet.</td>

I will simply give three strikes with my cane from here. If your karmic obstacles are meant to be eradicated, they will definitely be eradicated. If your karmic obstacles are too heavy, then three strikes of the cane will not get rid of them all. In time you will have more chances to be struck. Of the three strikes of the cane, the first one beats away your body karma, the second one beats away your mouth karma, and the third one beats away your mind karma. Only when the three karmas of body, mouth, and mind are purified will you get to taste the flavor of the Dharma.</td>

If all minds did not exist, of what use would all dharmas be? Therefore, if you feel the three strikes, that's good, and if you don't feel them, that's also good. If you feel something, there is no need to publicize it, for if you do, people will think I hired you to advertise for me. If you feel nothing, it is because your karmic obstacles are too heavy, and even the Buddhas' power cannot aid you. You should feel great shame and remorse. If you have no response, don't say that this is all false. You cannot distinguish between the true and the false, for the true also contains some falseness, and the false also contains some truth. Everything is made from the mind. If your mind is not true, then even the true becomes false. If your mind is true, then even if it is false, you will have a great response.</td>

Do not criticize anyone. If he is bad, if he is wrong, that is his fault and his offense. Once you speak about his faults, you become partly responsible for his offense. Although you do it out of compassion, I think you will take a big loss. From morning to night, you wash others' clothes, but never notice how dirty your own clothes are. This point is basic to being a human being, and we should recognize it. It should not be that you arrive in confusion and leave in a confusion. At birth, you are wrapped in the blanket of confusion, and at death you go to the coffin of confusion. Failing to understand, you die. All of you think about this; you are just working for others, but you are not at all clear about your own affairs.</td>

These birds can live without eating. They don't drink, yet they don't get thirsty. They don't eat, yet they don't feel hungry. Ordinary birds, on the other hand, will gobble up any worm they see. They take the lives of other creatures. The birds in the Land of Ultimate Bliss do not kill, nor do the people there. So that's why Shakyamuni Buddha praised the Land of Ultimate Bliss as a place where beings are free of the myriad sufferings and only experience all kinds of joy. Since Shakyamuni Buddha doesn't lie, we should deeply believe in and not have the slightest doubt about the Land of Ultimate Bliss.</td>
