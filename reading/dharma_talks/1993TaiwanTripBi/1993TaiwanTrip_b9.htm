People are just going along with the crowd and not being truly earnest in repenting, reciting the Sutras, bowing to the Buddhas, and bowing in repentance. It seems that people are not very enthusiastic or sincere. However, when we speak the Dharma, we should deliver the Dharma into each listener's ear and heart, so that he or she will remember it. The Dharma must be spoken with a strong, resonant voice. My own voice is not very resonant at this time, because I have a cold and cannot cough out the phlegm in my throat. Taiwan's climate is different from America's, and especially at this time of year with the fluctuating heat and cold, I was caught unprepared. That's why my voice is not very clear. Since people hope I will speak, I will try my best, with apologies to my listeners.</td>

They shouldn't talk so fast that everything runs together and sounds like popping firecrackers, because then the audience won't be able to catch what they are saying. People who talk like that should not come up to speak the Dharma. Those who speak the Dharma should be serious and solemn, not sloppy and giggling and with no sense of proper deportment. If you speak in such a sloppy manner, people cannot understand what you are saying. Not to mention other people, even I couldn't hear clearly. Since I am a stupid person, if someone does not speak clearly, then I cannot hear clearly and I won't know what he is saying.</td>

If their talk is to be translated, they should talk for three minutes and leave three minutes for translation. If you don't know how to speak clearly, then you shouldn't insist on speaking. Each person's talk and translation should take a total of six minutes. Four speakers is enough for one day. The four should know how to speak well, because if they say something meaningless in front of such a large audience, people will get bored. They won't want to sit there, but they are too polite to get up and leave. Every speaker should pay close attention to this. Every single sentence you say up here has to penetrate into people's hearts. It shouldn't be that you are the only one who understands, and no one else knows what you are talking about. That's like "the Mongolian who goes to the opera and listens in vain (because he can't understand)." This is important.</td>

No matter where I go, the people I bring along with me are in school, and this school trains people to speak the Dharma. They practice in the monastery and also on trips. We shouldn't have too many speakers in one day. Every day, it's not for sure whether or not I will come to the Dharma Assembly. So you shouldn't expect me. If I have time, I will come, but if I don't have time, then I won't come. Though I may not come in person, my spirit will be with the Dharma Assembly. Why will my spirit be here? Because I want to see how sincere everyone is. Is everyone joyfully attending the Dharma Assembly, or just mindlessly following the crowd? At the beginning of my talk today, I said that people have not been sincere enough. It's not that you are insincere. You do have a bit of sincerity, but it's not enough.</td>

Then no one will say that the men and women are not treated equally, that only the men get to speak and not the women, or that only the women get to speak and not the men. Now, since there are fewer men and more women, we can have one Bhikshu and three Bhikshunis speak each day. Those who come up to speak should know how to speak. In speaking the Dharma, you have to use the "Dharma-speaking" voice. Your voice should be well-modulated and you should use a variation of long and short sounds, and of high, low, and medium pitches. What you say should have real meaning in it. No matter what your topic is, don't ramble. Be straightforward so that everyone can understand. That's the way to speak the Dharma to ordinary people. Don't deliberately say things in a lofty and profound way and leave everyone bewildered. That way, the more you say, the more confused people become! That's not the way to speak Dharma. Avoid being pedantic. Just speak the Dharma in plain words, and that will do. In this day and age, people have no time to listen to theoretical, rambling speeches.</td>

A robber will hold someone up and rob his money; when you block my way to make offerings, it's the same the principle.

What is it I want to say? I have already been living in the United States for over thirty years, which is not a short time. Both Americans and Chinese people have been suggesting to me that I change my nationality and become an American citizen. They say that having an American passport makes it convenient to travel anywhere in the world. Americans are respected wherever they go, but it's different with a Chinese passport. If you have a passport from the Republic of China, the Communists will not grant you a visa to enter their country. The Communists will discriminate against you. If you have a passport from the People's Republic of China, people will be even more afraid of you wherever you go. They are afraid not because China is a big country with a large population, but because the government might give them trouble. So the best thing is to become an American citizen as soon as possible.</td>

Well, it certainly wasn't out of fear of the Communist Party that I went abroad. In Manchuria, when I left Harbin and went to Jilin, I was free to go. When I wanted to return, they required a special pass. Since I did not have a residence in the Communist area, I had no way to obtain a pass, so I couldn't go back. From Jilin, I went to Jinzhou. After I left Harbin, it was taken by the Communists. When I arrived in Jilin, the Nationalist Party was still in control there, but communication was cut off between Jilin and Harbin. When I went to Changchun, it was impossible to return to Jilin. I went to Liaoning and thought about returning to Harbin. Everyone was very concerned and urged me not to go back. I then went to Tianjin and stayed in the Great Compassion Temple. At that time I was still a Shramanera (novice monk). Later I left Tianjin and went to Shanghai, and afterwards to Wuchang. All along the way, as soon as I left a place, that place would be occupied by the Communists. In this way, I arrived in Guangzhou on the eighteenth of the eighth lunar month. From there I went to Hong Kong. About three days after I left, Guangzhou was also captured by the Communists, and after I arrived in Hong Kong there was no way to return to Guangzhou.</td>

I told him to look for a Good and Wise Advisor in Taiwan and to take refuge with the Triple Jewel, for he was Jewish. I introduced him to several Dharma Masters in Taiwan, and he visited them, but felt no affinities with them. It wasn't the people that he felt no affinities for, but the money. All the Buddhist activities in Taiwan require money. No matter what teacher he wanted to take refuge with, he was expected to give a donation (in a red envelope). Since he hardly had any money, he didn't take refuge. He returned and asked to take refuge with me. I told him to wait awhile.</td>

I say that Taiwan is like a pile of eggs; do you know why? Every person is out for himself. They are not united. The business people who have struck it rich and made a lot of money should loyally do all they can to repay the kindness of the land. None of them believe in the country. What proof is there? They invest all their money in other countries, thus scattering the wealth of their own country abroad. So the business people are not loyal enough. Even if you're as wealthy as everyone else put together, if you have no sense of loyalty to your country, then you are still a poor person! You are a person who does not understand principle, who does not love his country, and who knows only to be selfish and self-benefitting. That's one point.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">Though I've left the home-life, I haven't forgotten my heart's allegiance. Although I've left home, I haven't forgotten my loyalty to the country. I am Chinese, and I'll always be Chinese. In every life, in every place, I am Chinese. When China truly becomes great and strong, I may or may not be around. Whether I am still living or not, I hope that throughout my life, at the very least, I will not change my nationality. I am not greedy for convenience. Therefore, I said, "Not changing my nationality, I trace my roots back to their source." I will not change my citizenship, and I will not forget my roots. Now all of you can probably understand a bit about me.</td>
