I am requesting the Triple Jewel to confer aid upon all of you, so that your wishes may be fulfilled and everything may turn out auspiciously. I transfer any blessings I have to all the living beings in this Way-place. I would like to transfer to living beings who are outside as well, but they are too far away to receive my influence. As for the people in this Dharma-hall, I hope their calamities and diseases are dispelled, their offenses are wiped away, and blessings are created. I hope that everything is lucky and just as they wish, that their blessings increase and their lives are lengthened. This is how I pray for everyone when I recite these lines of mantra.</td>

Further, you must not be selfish, pursue personal benefit, or seek anything at all. You must not crave wealth or sex, or fight for fame or profit. If you can refrain from those, you will receive a great response when you recite and uphold the mantra. If you do not follow this path, you will probably not get the response you seek. Therefore, the first step is to hold the precepts.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">What is meant by precepts? Precepts refer to not fighting, not being greedy, not seeking anything, not being selfish, not wanting self benefit, and not telling lies. Don't go looking for the precepts in the books on precepts. Precepts can be practiced by anyone. If you can strictly uphold the rules of not fighting, not being greedy, not seeking anything, not being selfish, not wanting self benefit, and not telling lies, then the Buddhas of the ten directions will constantly protect you, be mindful of you, and aid you. Don't think that you can receive the Buddhas' aid just because you understand the rules of not fighting, not being greedy, not seeking anything, not being selfish, not wanting self benefit, and not telling lies. The Buddhas will not aid you for merely understanding and reciting these rules. You have to personally practice them. You have to refrain from breaking these six precepts before you can receive the Buddhas' aid and protection. It is not a matter of just reciting them, or understanding what they mean. It only counts if you really understand them. If you only have a little understanding, you may think it is enough, but it isn't. You must practice them all your life, and even then you will not be perfect.</td>

If I were to say what you like to hear first, then you wouldn't have any place to put what you don't like to hear, and you wouldn't be able to listen to it! So now, I will bring up a small condition. What condition? Every time I come to Taiwan, I am very nervous, because the rest of my delegation is never made to feel welcome. People only welcome me and do not welcome the members of my delegation. Why do I say this? Every time my delegation members accompany me, there is never any room for them to bow to the Buddha when we go to a temple, and there is never any room in the car for them. A car was prepared for my delegation, but the group from Taiwan got in first and didn't leave any room for the members of my delegation even to stand, much less to sit. So I feel very sorry for the members of my delegation. Do you mean to bully the people from other places by treating them like this? I don't understand it.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">Also, when it was time to bow to the Buddha, the members of my delegation were all squeezed up in the front. Recognizing them as part of my delegation, people chased them away, saying, "This is my place. You can't stand here." They went to the back, but there was no room to bow or stand there either. I feel very sorry for the members of my delegation. They have exhausted themselves coming such a long way with me, hoping to create affinities with the Buddhists of Taiwan. Instead, they were rejected by the Buddhists here. Who are the people who have mistreated the members of my delegation? They are people who went to stay at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, and when they came back, they said my people had been too cold to them, to the point that they almost froze to death. That is why they are seeking revenge now that we have come to Taiwan. Do you think I still dare to come?</td>

Having come, don't you think I'm worried that what happened to our delegation in the past will happen again? This time, I am announcing in advance that my way must not be blocked when I am walking. No one should make an offering to me as I am walking. If anyone tries to do that, I will not accept it. Why? You try to make an offering as I'm walking, thinking I'm greedy for offerings, and that I am happy that you stop me. What I detest most is for people to make offerings to me. Why? Because I have little virtue. My virtue is not enough to influence and transform people. Such a poor monk of little virtue as I am does not deserve to receive people's offerings. Don't think it makes me happy to see that so-and-so's red envelope contains the biggest offering. If I were greedy for red envelopes, I wouldn't need to come to Taiwan. Even though Taiwan is called "Treasure Island," it has changed. Now it seems to be permeated with the odor of horse, pig, and cow manure. "Treasure Island" has turned into "Manure Island."</td>

Taiwan is caught up in superstition. These people don't know what authentic Buddhism is, nor do they know what phony Buddhism is. When they hear that someone has a famous reputation, they think he must represent Buddhism. Buddhists should not do business. Even if they say, "I am self-sufficient," doing business in Buddhism is not the ultimate way. All kinds of problems are involved in planting this kind of blessings. You should not take the false to be true. Don't listen to false advertisements by people who just brag about and praise themselves.</td>

How did I manage to charm them to the point that they would give away all their money to follow me? The reason is that when left-home people have no money, they can cultivate. As soon as they have money, they absolutely cannot cultivate. I guarantee this. You can look into this. We talk about poor Taoists and about poor monks, but never about rich Taoists or rich monks. There is no such thing. If you take your money and make offerings to "rich monks" of "the Way of wealth," you are creating offenses. What I've said will upset a lot of people. Even though they will be upset, I must speak the truth. I cannot remain silent and refrain from telling everyone the truth.</td>
