                  </b>
                  <p class="commentary4">Answer: Those of you who want to support and protect Buddhism should look into things calmly. You should proceed if it is the Way, and retreat if it is not. Sometimes you create merit and virtue by donating money, but sometimes you commit offenses by giving money. You should think it over carefully. A left-home person cannot have money. Once he has money, he will become unruly. If you "help" him [by giving him money], he will just go eat, drink, visit prostitutes, and gamble. If he gets enough money, he will go back to laylife. If you do not "help" him, he will still cultivate. This is especially true when he is staying all by himself. If he has enough food to eat, that will do.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">Answer: Those of you who do business in Taiwan should love your country and be loyal to your country. Use the wisdom that you have in doing business to help your country. There are many people in Taiwan with tremendous fortunes, but none of them really love their country. The people of Taiwan are making investments in mainland China not out of a sense of patriotism, but as a means of exploiting the opportunity to make more profit. During this unusual time, those who think they can make a profit without putting in any capital risk the danger of getting nothing at all in return. The political situation of the Communists will also change. Once the Communist Party is gone, the investors may end up greatly disappointed, because the inconsistent policies there are such that "orders issued in the morning are often changed by the evening."</td>

So you shouldn't put all your efforts into doing business in the mainland. Since it is Communist country, we should try to help it out. Its inconsistent policies have kept the people in a state of fear.</td>

                  <p class="commentary">答：临安那时就是将相不和，所以导致国家灭亡。现在在这个小地方两党相争，上下交征利。民进党和国民党互争长短，打架很野蛮，上有好之者，下必有甚焉。打架得来的，将来也会打架失去的。国民党内部也有问题，都是互相倾轧，争权夺利，水火不分。如果不改，绝对不会有光明的前途。现在台湾最大失败之处就是不团结，将来两败俱伤，渔翁得利。这渔翁指的不光是共产党，也包括外国人。总之，一胡闹，人家唾手而得。</td>

                  <p class="commentary4"><b>Q: Why do you say that Taiwan's situation now is like that of the Southern Song dynasty in Ling An?
                  </b>
                  <p class="commentary4">A: During the Ling An period, the generals and ministers didn't get along well, so eventually the country fell apart. Now, in this small place, two parties are vying for power and profit. The Progessive Party and the Nationalist Party are fighting with each other and contending in a very rude way. If the people in high position like to fight, the people below will be even worse. In fact, anything gained by fighting will be lost in the same way. Even within the Nationalist Party, people are as antagonistic as fire and water, mutually trying to subvert each other, usurping power for themselves, and depriving others of their rights. If they do not change their attitudes, they will not have any bright future to speak of. Taiwan's greatest failure right now is that the people cannot cooperate with each other. In the future, they will cause their own ruin, and the bystanders will take advantage of them. These bystanders are not referring only to the Communists, but also to foreigners as well. In general, if they start quarrelling recklessly, the bystanders will easily come down on them.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">A: We should conduct ourselves with virtue by not fighting, not being greedy, not seeking, not being selfish, not pursuing personal advantage, and not lying. These guidelines are the basis for being a human being. They are the foundation for cultivating the Way, and a standard for government. If we can follow them, we will be able to overthrow the Communist Party without using a single gun or cannon. The Communists have won their success by exploiting people's greed. They claim that they do not discriminate between the rich and the poor, but this is in name only. In reality, those in the positions of authority are so rich that their wealth is comparable to that of the national treasury.   Right now, within the Communist Party, there are avaricious and corrupt officials who resort to underhanded tactics to get money in any way they can. It is as if they have thirty-six legs and more greed and aggressiveness than anyone else.</td>

If they continue to deprecate each other, they will just be hurting themselves. If the Progressive Party overthrows the Nationalist Party, the Progessive Party will not last long either. Unfortunately, they do not understand this. Those who fight for political reasons are just "people who have blessings but do not know how to enjoy them and who are looking for trouble where there is none." Now they are clamoring for independence [from the mainland], but this amounts to stirring rebellion in the nest and killing one's own kin. We shouldn't create divisions. If we can unite in harmony and work together in peace, then we will bring blessings to our country. If we cannot be this way and just want to protect ourselves, then we are just trying to run away from the crisis. We should not calculate for our own safety. Rather, we should be willing to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of the country.</td>

Why are Catholicism and Protestantism so widespread? It's because the Bible has been translated into the languages of different countries. If all the Buddhist Sutras are translated into foreign languages, Buddhism will not fall behind Catholicism and Protestantism. At the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, I hope to bring all religions together in harmony, and allow each of them to hold their religious ceremonies in the temple. I believe that if we can encompass and accept them all, it will lessen the biases and discrimination among them.</td>
