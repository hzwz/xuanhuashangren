Even after he had conducted the Taking Refuge ceremony and taken them as disciples, he still didn't know what sect we belong to or how to give them Dharma names. He had absolutely no idea. When the people who had taken refuge asked for Dharma names, he had no choice but to call me on the phone to ask what sect we belong to and what names to give them. How embarrassing! When those elder monks saw that, the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas really lost its reputation. Seventy or eighty people took refuge with him, and it turns out most of them were juvenile homosexuals.</td>

                <p class="commentary4">When laypeople correspond with left-home people, they usually write on the envelope either "Open in respect" or "Open in purity." If you write "Open in purity," do you wish the recipient to be pure, or yourself to be pure? It's ambiguous. If you wish the recipient to be pure, that means you know he's not pure, so you want him to become pure. Isn't that right? As for "Open in respect," are you asking people to respect the writer? Or does it mean that you, the writer, respect the people who read the letter? It doesn't make a lot of sense. Whether you write "Open in respect" or "Open in purity," it is grammatically incorrect. However, many people use these phrases. In fact, most of the people who write to me use them. They don't even understand such superficial things as the etiquette of an address. Also, some laypeople write letters to left-home people in which they close with the phrase, "Placing my palms together." But when a left-home person who understands etiquette writes to left-home people, he will use the more respectful closing, "Bowing my head to the ground" or simply "Making a half-bow." When writing to his equal, he should use "Bowing my head to the ground," not "Making a half-bow." When left-home people write to laypeople, they should not even say "Placing my palms together." They may just use a simple "To be opened by so-and-so." If you place your palms together for a layperson, you are violating the precepts. Of course, when laypeople place their palms together first, you may return the gesture. In writing a letter, you don't know whether or not the recipient has placed his palms together, so it doesn't make sense to say "Placing my palms together." Even people who have studied for many years still fail to understand these fine points.</td>
