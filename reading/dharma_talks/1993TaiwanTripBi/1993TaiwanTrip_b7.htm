The main reason I have come toTaiwan this time is to bring blessings to all of you good men and good women. However, people may not recognize or understand my way of bringing blessings. Whether people recognize or understand it is not my concern. I only ask myself if I have done the work. I don't ask whether I will gain anything in return. This is my attitude in coming to Taiwan. Whether the people in Taiwan understand or not is not my concern. I am just telling everyone.</td>

Why? With my sick body, the doctors have told me to get a lot of rest and and not work too hard. Actually, I am not afraid of toil and I like to work hard, but since that's what the doctor said, I don't want to disobey him. So I said I would do a little less. This time, in fact I am taking a risk to my health in coming here. I'm not trying to scare you. The Dharma-protecting spirits kept telling me not to come. However, since I promised these good men and faithful women I would come, I could not worry about my own well-being. I will not worry about whether I live or die. If I have promised to do something, I will certainly do it.</td>

You can all hear from my voice that my throat is blocked up, so my voice isn't very clear. In spite of this, I have come to the Dharma Assembly. I cannot be lazy and take a break, making the young people work harder. Some Dharma-protectors did not approve of my coming, saying I was endangering my life by coming here when I am sick. I said that I see life and death as being the same, with little difference. I said that forgetting the body for the sake of the Dharma is the basic duty of a disciple of the Buddha. So I have come to Taiwan to hold this Dharma Assembly.</td>

If you seek things, then I'm afraid you will not obtain them. The things you seek will be like "reflections of flowers in a mirror or of the moon in water"--you can see them but you can't grasp them.

In this way, I increased the number of bows I made every day. Later on, I also bowed to the most evil people as well. Whatever I do, I do it on a grand scale. I bowed to bad people, hoping that they would mend their ways and become good, bring forth the resolve for Bodhi, and attain the Buddha Way.</td>

What about them?" And so I began bowing to them as well. Other people bow to the great Buddhas and great Bodhisattvas, but I very foolishly thought of the big evil-doers and the bad guys. These people are very pitiful, because the longer they turn on the wheel of the six paths of rebirth, the farther they get from the Buddha Way.

                  <p class="commentary4">Who are the demon descendants? They are the Buddhist disciples themselves in the Dharma-ending Age. In the past when I came to Taiwan and Bai Sheng was still alive, he spread the rumor that I was a Communist. A few decades ago in Taiwan, if you were labelled a Communist, people would think you were a traitor and a spy, and you would definitely be put in jail. So when I arrived in Taiwan, no monk dared to go meet me at the airport, because I was a Communist! None of the well-known Dharma-protecting laypeople went to meet my plane, either. Only the elder Upasaka Zhou Xuanzhe knew better than to fear my "Communist connections" and came to meet my plane. Another layman, Dong Zhengzhi, also met me and saw me off. He probably wasn't afraid that I was a Communist either. Later, there was also Huang Daren and some other people whom I cannot remember. At that time, if you were labeled a Communist, everyone would fear you as they would fear a tiger. They would think you were as ferocious as a tiger that could hurt them at any time. That was when I first came to Taiwan.</td>

                  <p class="commentary4">Later on, I sent five American disciples to Taiwan to receive the precepts. Although the people of Taiwan were wary of the Communist Party, they were not afraid of the United States. So my disciples caused quite an uproar, and afterwards the five of them were subjected to interrogation. Who was interrogating them? I don't remember now,was it Hui Feng? He said, "These five all used to be hippies. None of them are up to any good. In America, Dharma Master To Lun would go to the park for recreation. He would sit down in the amphiheater, and hippies from every direction would gather around him. Then To Lun would explain the Buddhadharma to them. The hippies didn't quite understand Chinese, but after someone translated for them, they felt the Dharma had some principle to it. Then he would lure them to his temple, where he would give lectures, which someone translated for them. Then they all left the home-life. That's how he came to have American disciples." That was one of their explanations.</td>

When Americans take one pill of the drug, they show their true selves and feel on top of the world, very free and easy, as if they've gone to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. To Lun himself can take more than ten pills without any effect." That's what they tell people.</td>

They aren't able to do that. To Lun teaches his disciples to wear the sash every day, to never be apart from their sash, and they think that's really weird. They say, "The hippies go to his place and find everything very convenient: The food is free and so is the lodging. That's how he lured these drug-addicted hippies there. Now they've decided to leave the home-life, but they haven't changed their bad character."</td>
