                  <i> Great Compassion Mantra</i>, and the <i> Six-Character Great Bright Mantra</i> both belong to the Secret School. The

                  <p class="commentary4">Ignorant people say that secret things are the best. Why? Because they are secret, and not publicly transmitted. So people who don't understand the Buddhadharma speak of the supernatural and mysterious saying, "Oh! I can't tell this to you! It's from the Secret School, and it can't be spoken for you to hear!" If they can't speak of it to others, why mention it? Why do they say they can't talk about it? If it's really the Secret School, and it's best not to speak of it, why do they say, "I can't tell you"? Their "not talking" is just talking about it. Is this "refusal to speak of it" speaking of it or not? Yes, it's speaking of it. Why do they talk this way? Because they don't understand the Buddhadharma, and are completely unaware of what the Secret School is.</td>

It means "light perfectly illuminating", and is also defined as "the opening of the lotus". It is analogous to the wonderful lotus flower, which can complete, perfect, and fulfill, without obstruction. It is the wonderful mind of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. This is

Because my talking does not even contain one ten—thousandth part of it. What is it? If you are able to constantly recite and maintain the        
                  <i> Six-Character Great Bright Mantra</i>, there will be six paths      
                  of light changing the darkness of the six paths into brightness. It is necessary that you turn your mind to one when reciting this mantra to obtain this type of samadhi. Then, not only will the six paths put forth light, but all of the ten dharma realms will become the "great light bright treasury". So now we know that the        
                  <i> Six-Character Great Bright Mantra </i> has great strength. I hope that everyone will set aside time from his or her activities to recite the
