                为什么说吃肉是死了上当？无论你吃什么东西，便有那种成分在你身上。你吃菜，便有一股菜味；吃葱，便有一股葱味；吃牛奶，便有一股牛奶味；吃吉士，身上便有一股吉士味；吃大蒜，呼吸气都有大蒜味。因为你所吃的东西，要与你合股，合而为一，变成你身上的一部份。你吃什么吃多了，身体就会变成和它一样。因此，吃猪肉多了，便会变猪；吃牛肉多了，便会变牛，这是合乎科学和逻辑学的。你的身体和肉类变为合伙公司；死了之后，也会变成那样东西。比如，死后要是周身一股猪味，阎罗王嘟嘟鼻子，便说：“你这样臭，还是去做猪好了。”羊牛鸡犬，也都是同一个道理，所以说是死后上当。

                Why will you take a loss after death if you eat meat? Well, your
				body is composed of the foods you eat. If you eat vegetables,
				you will smell like vegetables; if you eat onions, you'll smell
				like onions; drink milk, and you'll smell like milk; eat cheese,
				and you'll smell like cheese. If you eat some garlic, your
				breath will smell of garlic. The things you eat become part of
				your body. If you eat a lot of a certain thing, your body will
				become very similar to it. Therefore, if you eat a lot of pork,
				you will become a pig. Eat a lot of beef, and you will become a
				cow. This accords with science and logic. The meat you eat
				incorporates with your body, and after you die you turn into
				that kind of animal. If you smell like a pig, for instance,
				after you die King Yama takes a sniff and says, &quot;You smelly
				thing, you should be reborn as a pig.&quot; The same goes for sheep,
				cows, chicken, and dogs. That's what I mean by being cheated
				after death.

                You can investigate this carefully. Why does a butcher of pigs
