          神光法师听了法后，这时觉得臂痛了；以前他没有想到臂，只是想方法教雪变成红的，把臂痛也忘了。在达摩祖师为他讲完法后，这时他生了分别心：“啊！我剁下来这只胳臂好痛！”于是对达摩祖师说：“哎呀！我现在心很痛，受不了了！请祖师替我安心。” 
          </p>
          <p class="commentary">达摩祖师就说：“你心痛？把你的心拿来给我，我才可以帮你把心安好，这才不会痛。” </p>

          神光法师就找自己的心，心在什么地方？东西南北四维上下，所有的地方都找遍了，觅心了不可得！于是对达摩祖师说：“我找不着心，没有。” </p>
          <p class="commentary">达摩祖师说：“我与汝安心竟！”你找不着心，我已经给你安完了！ </p>
          <p class="commentary">
          二祖一听这话，豁然开悟了！就这么一句话，豁然就开了大悟。开了大悟，心也不痛，肝也不痛，汗毛梢也不痛了。从此之后，就依照达摩祖师传给他的法门来修行。这叫“直指人心，见性成佛，教外别传，不立文字”的法门。 
          </p>
          <p class="commentary">
          二祖得到这个法门，就传给三祖，三祖传给四祖，四祖传给五祖，五祖传给六祖，于是这法就在中国一代一代地传。现在这法到美国来了；可是到这儿来，没有人跪九年，也不需要跪九年，现在只要你们能真心修行，就可以得到这个法。 </td>

          Dharma, his arm began to hurt. A while ago, he hadn't thought about 
          his arm; he only thought about how he could get the snow to turn red. 
          He forgot all about the pain in his arm. But after Patriarch 
          Bodhidharma had finished explaining the Dharma to him, his discursive 
          mind became active again. &quot;Oow! The stump of the arm I just cut off 
          really hurts!&quot; Then he said to Patriarch Bodhidharma, &quot;Ouch! My mind 
          is in pain. I can't stand it! Please, Patriarch, quiet my mind.&quot; </p>

          Bodhidharma. &quot;Bring out your mind and show it to me. Then I will help 
          quiet it for you and you won't feel any more pain.&quot; 
            <p class="commentary">Dharma Master Shen Guang searched for his 
            mind. Where was his mind? He looked in the north, east, south, west, 
            in the intermediate points, and up and down. It was simply not to be 
            found anywhere! At last he said to Patriarch Bodhidharma, &quot;I can't 
            find my mind! It is nowhere to be found.&quot; </p>
            <p class="commentary">&quot;I have already finished quieting your mind!&quot; 
            said the Patriarch. &quot;You can't find your mind; I have already calmed 
            it for you.&quot; </p>
            <p class="commentary">Upon hearing that, the Second Patriarch 
            suddenly became enlightened. Those few words brought him to a great 
            awakening. Having achieved a profound awakening, his mind no longer 
            hurt, his liver did not hurt, nor did the tips of the hairs in his 
            pores. From that time on, he cultivated the Dharma door taught by 
            Patriarch Bodhidharma, known as &quot;a direct pointing to the human mind 
            that leads to seeing the nature and realizing Buddhahood; a special 
            transmission beyond the teaching that is not set forth in words or 
            language.&quot; </p>
            <p class="commentary">The Second Patriarch transmitted this Dharma  
            door to the Third Patriarch, who in turn passed it to the Fourth  
            Patriarch. The Fourth Patriarch transmitted it to the Fifth  
            Patriarch. The Fifth Patriarch then transmitted that Dharma to the  
            Sixth Patriarch. That Dharma has been passed down from generation to  
            generation in China. Now it has come to America. But here in  
            America, no one has knelt for nine years, and no one needs to. All  
            you have to do is to bring forth a true mind to cultivate; then you  
            will be able to attain this Dharma. </p>
