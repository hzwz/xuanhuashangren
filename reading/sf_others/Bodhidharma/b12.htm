          个穷和尚来到我的国家，对我讲话，还这么不客气！”所以就对达摩祖师疏远了。达摩祖师虽然想要救度他，要对他有一种慈悲心，但是他不接受，不向达摩祖师求，那也没法子了；于是达摩祖师就走了，不管他了。

          结果，过了一个时期，梁武帝果然被侯景带着一些个人马，把他饿死在台城里，这是有这么一个原因。你们大家想一想，如果他有功德，怎么会饿死？因为没有功德，所以就饿死了。达摩祖师当时本想挽救，不教他饿死，希望他能生一种觉悟心，可惜梁武帝这个吾我太大了，所以就是达摩祖师也救不了他。 </td>

            <p class="commentary"> Bodhidharma saw that the Emperor had done so many  
          good deeds that he could have  
          redeemed his offense with the merit and virtue created. However, to do so there must be some  
            conditions. That's why the Patriarch was not polite to him. But the  
            Emperor thought to himself, &quot;I am an emperor, a great emperor, and  
            you are only a poor monk. You come to my country and are utterly  
            rude to me.&quot; So he alienated himself from the Patriarch. Though  
            Patriarch Bodhidharma wanted to save him and brought forth a  
            compassionate mind toward him, the Emperor could not accept him.  
            Because the Emperor made no move to seek help from the Patriarch,  
            there was nothing the Patriarch could do to help him. Thus, the  
            Patriarch left and paid no more attention to the Emperor. </p> 
            <p class="commentary">What happened as a result was that after a  
            period of time, Emperor Wu was captured and starved to death in the  
            palace by Hou Jing and his people. Such was the cause and effect.  
            You all think about it. If the Emperor actually had merit and  
            virtue, how could he have starved to death? It was because he did  
            not have merit and virtue that he died of hunger. Patriarch  
            Bodhidharma wanted to save him from his fate by helping him reach an  
            awakening. What a pity that Emperor Wu of Liang's ego was so big  
            that even Patriarch Bodhidharma could not save him. </p>
