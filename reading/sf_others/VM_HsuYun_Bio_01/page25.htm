          二十八岁至三十岁时。皆居岩洞采山草叶充饥。不食人间烟火。初时屡现胜境。而不着境。一心正观念佛。日久身轻体健。步履如飞。耳聪目明。可察秋毫。二瞳炯然。人见以为魅。怖而疾奔。</p>

			<p class="commentary">From his twenty-eighth to his thirtieth years, 
			the Master dwelt in a cliff cave, gathering mountain grasses and 
			herbs to satisfy his hunger. He did not partake of the cooked food 
			of others. At the outset, a glorious state of being often appeared, 
			and yet he did not become attached when he was in such a state. He 
			properly and single-mindedly recited the Buddha<span lang="en-us">'</span>s name. As the days 
			passed, his body became lighter, and he was quite robust. It was as 
			if he were flying when he walked. His hearing was acute and his eyes 
			could clearly discern the most minute detail. The pupils of his 
			<span lang="en-us">eye</span>s 
			glowed so that when people saw him<span lang="en-us">,</span> they thought he 
			<span lang="en-us">w</span>as a goblin 
			and took to their heels in fright! </p>
			<p class="subtitle6">The verse says:<br>
			Dwelling in a wilderness cave in a primitive  
			way, <br>
			Knowing contentment, his desires were few<span lang="en-us">-</span>there was no  
			wrangling. <br>
			He did not speak but observed his mind<span lang="en-us">-</span>how it arises  
			and dwells. <br> 
			Roaming through the triple world, he ventured east and  
			west.</p> </td>
