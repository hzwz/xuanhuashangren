                            <p class="articleb">My life took a significant turn when I was fortunate enough to meet the Venerable Master. It has been the Master’s fourteenth vow that has influenced me and changed my life the most. That vow says,
							“I vow that all living beings who see my face or even hear my voice will fix their thoughts on Bodhi
							and quickly accomplish the Buddha Way.”</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	I remember that the first time I met the Master was in 1978, on his first visit to Malaysia. At that time I was emotionally upset because I had discovered that my husband was not true to his marriage vows. My marriage and relationship with my husband deteriorated day by day until it reached an unbearable stage which sent me to the verge of insanity. Destiny and past conditions brought me to meet the All-Knowing Advisor─our Venerable Master. The Master advised me to chant Guanshiyin Bodhisattva’s name and walk upon the Buddhist path. In following the Master’s advice, I worked earnestly each day at chanting Guanshiyin Bodhisattva’s name and turned my focus towards the higher values of life. To my surprise I was able to control my anger, and I developed great tolerance and patience to the extent that harmony in the family was restored. I was able to cope with my husband’s ways until he passed away in 1984.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	In 1986, I met the Master again in the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB) for the celebration of CTTB’s tenth anniversary. I asked the Master,
								“Do you remember me?” The Master, without any hesitation, told me what I had confided in him eight years ago. I was struck with awe as I realized the meaning of spiritual penetrations.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	Prior to my encounters with the Master, I had sought enjoyment associating with high society and leading a superficial lifestyle. After these years of following Master’s teaching and practices, I have discovered a transcendental peace through bowing daily to the Buddhas, reciting the Sutras, and going on a full vegetarian diet. These have brought about a joy and happiness which I’ve never experienced before.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The best thing that has happened in my life is my taking refuge with the Master. The strength and determination of his great vows have been instrumental in setting me on the path of Buddhist cultivation and in teaching me to lead a happy and meaningful life. I am very grateful to the Venerable Master and will always be indebted to him.</p>
