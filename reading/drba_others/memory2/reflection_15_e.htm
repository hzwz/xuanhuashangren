                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">Today, we gather here in this Assembly Commemorating the Venerable Master Hua. I’ll give a report on the Venerable Master’s virtuous kindness by collecting the Master’s fine words and deeds, for the purpose of commemoration as well as to set forth a moral standard of conduct for everyone. All of us are extremely grieved, and remorseful over the passing into stillness of the Venerable Master. His remarkable deeds are as vast as the ocean; one would not be able to describe them exhaustively in a brief interval of time. Publications of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, such as <em>Vajra Bodhi Sea, Source of Wisdom, Instructional Talks</em> and <em>Records of the Life</em> of the Master, and other works written by the Master, as well as various explanations of Sutras by the Master, document the Master’s speeches and lines of thought. These works have already been edited and translated. The following is a brief report that relates my personal opinion of, and experience with, the Venerable Master. Kindly correct me if I make any mistake.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	Firstly, I shall talk about the conditions concerning my appointment by the Dharma Realm Buddhist University. In 1985, I was the principal of a technical college in Taiwan. When I came to visit America, I called on the Venerable Master at Gold Mountain Monastery. As I am also from Shuangcheng County, Manchuria, I had heard of the Venerable Master long ago. In our first meeting, the Venerable Master invited me for a tour of the University at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, and cordially invited me to join the educational service at the University after my retirement. I was surprised, yet honored; as I had taken refuge with the Triple Jewel for many years, if I could contribute to any Buddhist work in any possible way, I would be most willing. So I accepted the offer immediately and thanked the Venerable Master for his high expectation of me.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	I have been working in the Dharma Realm Buddhist University for seven years since 1988, after my retirement in Taiwan. Due to several unforeseen circumstances, I regret that I have not been able to live up to the Venerable Master’s expectation or to fulfill my responsibilities.</p>
							<p class="articleb">		The following is a summary of my understanding of the Venerable Master’s exhortations and instructions with regard to education:</p>
                       		<p class="articleb">
1. The Venerable Master said that education is the foundation of humankind,<br>&#58921;as well as the foundation of the world at large.<br>
2. Buddhism is the foundation of education.<br>
3. In order to propagate the Buddhadharma, one has to begin with education.<br>&#58921;Encourage young people to bring forth their resolve and take on the <br>&#58921;responsibilities of saving the world. <br>
4. Education was the Venerable Master’s life long ambition.<br>
5. Promoting moral education and establishing filial piety are some of the <br>&#58921;primary goals of moral education.<br>
6. Educate young people, and inspire them to bring forth their inherent wisdom.<br>
7. Practice the six guiding principles of: not fighting, not being greedy, not <br>&#58921;seeking, not being selfish, not pursuing personal advantage, and not lying.<br>
8. Promote volunteer education, and expand the scope of education.
</p>

                            <p class="articleb"> From the foregoing, we learned of the high expections of the Venerable Master with respect to education. Now, the Venerable Master has manifested entering into stillness and has left for the Western Land. Life is impermanent, like dew drops, like a lighting flash. We are extremely sad. Although his physical body has disappeared, his spirit and expression forever remain. As disciples of the Venerable Master, we ought to uphold his great vows, be harmonious and united, carry on the Buddhas’ wisdom life, strive and work together to propagate the Buddhadharma, and promote education. We sincerely pray that the Venerable Master will ride on his vows and compassionately return to establish a pure and blissful human world as well as the world of Avatamsaka (Flower Adornment).                            </p>
