                            <p class="articleb">My name is Li Guoji, and I took refuge with the Venerable Master Hua on July 6, 1988 at the Avatamsaka Sagely Monastery in Calgary, Canada. After taking refuge, I became a vegetarian and started to recite Sutras. I also went to the monastery almost every day to recite Sutras or to work. In 1990, my doctor told me I had cancer of the uterus. I was sick for two weeks, during which I stayed home and didn’t go to the monastery. The Dharma Master who managed Avatamsaka Sagely Monastery at the time thought it strange and asked a Buddhist friend how I was. When he found out about my sickness, he called Dharma Master Heng Chang at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and asked him to notify the Venerable Master. When the Venerable Master was informed, he kindly asked Dharma Master Heng Chang to pass this message:
							“Don’t worry. The disease is not serious. Have the disciples at Avatamsaka
							Monastery recite Sutras for her, and she’ll be
							okay.”                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	Before I entered the hospital, the Buddhist friends at Avatamsaka Monastery recited Sutras for me for a long time. During that time, I dreamed of the Venerable Master three times. One time, I dreamed that the Master gave some medicinal herbs to my friend and told her to make a decoction for me to drink. I stayed in the hospital for over twenty days. The first three days, I had examinations and electrotherapy. After resting for two weeks, I was given three more days of electrotherapy. After that treatment, I recovered steadily. It has been five years, and I have been quite healthy, without getting any other diseases. Thus I have been going to the monastery as usual to recite Sutras and work.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	In March of this year, I went to the hospital for a regular checkup. At a little after eight o’clock in the morning, I was in the waiting room reciting the name of Guanshiyin Bodhisattva and waiting to be called. There were many sick people waiting to see the doctor. All of a sudden, I saw the Venerable Master and Mr. Yu, who lives at the Avatamsaka Monastery, walk in. I immediately got on my knees and began bowing to the Master. The Master walked through the waiting room and disappeared. Right then, the nurse called me in for my checkup. When I came out again at around eleven o’clock, the waiting room was empty. I thought the Venerable Master must have compassionately come to save all those sick people.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	In the past few years, I went to the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas to participate in several major Dharma sessions and celebrations. During those times, when I bowed to the Venerable Master, I would sincerely pray to the Master to cure my sickness. Each time the Master would hit my head three times. When I returned and went for a checkup, the doctor would always ask me in surprise whether I had taken some other medicine. I would say,
							“No, I just drink Great Compassion Water and recite Sutras and mantras.” The doctor is puzzled because I have recovered so fast.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	My being able to recite Sutras and mantras today is completely due to the Venerable Master’s compassion, the concern of the two Dharma Masters, and the merit of my Buddhist friends at the Avatamsaka Monastery. Amitabha Buddha.</p>
