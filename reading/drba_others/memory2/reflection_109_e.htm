                            <p class="articleb">On February 1, 1993, at the Ten Thousand Buddhas Chun Kang Vegetarian Restaurant, Laywoman Guode, a volunteer worker, suggested that her fellow lay cultivators learn to recite mantras. After three weeks of practicing with them, one morning when I was reciting the Great Bright Six-syllable Mantra in the Buddhahall, I was suddenly overcome with sadness and started crying. I walked over to the Venerable Master’s image and sought aid from the Master. All of a sudden it became very bright, and I saw the Venerable Master at a distance. He was very adorned, holding a tin staff and leading countless people. Among them were Dharma Masters and laypeople I knew from the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, but there were many more that I didn’t recognize. I was also among them. The Venerable Master was reciting a mantra. Following behind him, we passed through a grove resembling the seven rows of trees in the Land of Ultimate Bliss as described in the Amitabha Sutra. Finally, as the sound of the mantra continued, we reached the shore of an ocean. I felt very light and happy. My mind was clear and bright, without afflictions. After experiencing this response, my faith in reciting mantras increased. Whenever afflictions come, I recite a mantra, and the afflictions vanish like smoke or clouds being dispersed, leaving my mind free of impediments.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The day after the Venerable Master’s body was moved from Long Beach Sagely Monastery to the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, I was pushing a cart of food from the main dining hall to the seniors’ home. I was reciting the Buddha’s name, as I usually do. All of a sudden, the Venerable Master appeared in front of me. He was walking in a slow and leisurely way between Vigor Way and Compassion Way (names of streets in the Sagely City). I instinctively wanted to bow to the Master, but the Master smiled and slightly lifted the staff he was holding in his hand, so I didn’t bow. Even though I didn’t bow, he continued to look at me in a very kindly way. </p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The Venerable Master’s body was temporarily placed in No Words Hall. When I went to behold the Master, if I had any difficulties on my mind, I would ask for advice, hoping the Master would instruct me.</p>

                              	In the days to come, I shall cultivate according to the Venerable Master’s Six Great Principles.</p>
