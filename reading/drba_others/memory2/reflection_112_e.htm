                            <p class="articleb">I believe that the Venerable Master has spiritual penetrations and that he shows kindness and compassion in every matter provided we are sincere in our thoughts and actions. He helps everyone without us knowing it. Here are some events which occurred and although they may appear trivial, they do show the ways in which the Venerable Master is kind and compassionate so long as we are sincere.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	<strong>Event 1:</strong> My wife and I were discussing certain matters pertaining to Dharma work in our house in Kuala Lumpur. We could not decide on the next course of action and it was pertinent then to have a reply from the Venerable Master. However we decided not to telephone the Master right then, as it was about midnight in San Francisco. To our surprise, the Venerable Master asked his attendant to telephone us from San Francisco about four hours later to give us the necessary guidance!</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	<strong>Event 2:
								</strong>Tze Yun Tung temple was a vacant temple that needed renovation and cleaning up before the official opening ceremony could be conducted. The temple was infested with white ants and these ants had been eating into several places including the altar. We used all means to coax the white ants to move out of the premises without having to exterminate them, which is against our principle of compassion. We were not successful and there was the fear that the ants would take a liking to the Dharma books. When my wife was in CTTB, she remembered to report to the Venerable Master about Tze Yun Tung being infested by white ants that were attacking the timber structure with voracious appetite.</p>
							<p class="articleb">
                              		At that time the Venerable Master just brushed this request aside, appearing not to want to be concerned about white ants. But by the time she came back to Malaysia, there was not a single white ant in Tze Yun Tung. The ants had just shifted out for no apparent reason.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	<strong>Event 3: </strong>My mother went to CTTB. She bowed 30,000 times to Guan Yin Bodhisattva in three weeks. One day she had the thought of wondering if Guan Yin Bodhisattva could hear what she said. That very night, the Venerable Master asked a disciple to convey to my mother that Guan Yin Bodhisattva can hear everything anywhere, even just a whisper. My mother also had worried whether her prayers would be answered. The Venerable Master again asked a disciple to convey a message that her prayers had been answered. </p>
