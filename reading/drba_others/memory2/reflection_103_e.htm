                            <p class="articleb">I always share the words of wisdom from Venerable Master Hua’s instructional talks with Rhosita.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	Early last year, she was diagnosed with a tiny cyst in her body. Mortified and depressed, she called me from overseas; I told her to keep reciting the Buddha’s name, calm down, and not panic.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The following day, on my way home from work, fear began to reign within me, but I kept reciting Buddha’s name until I reached home. I put down my personal belongings, washed my hands, and bowed before the Buddha. Later, I called Long Beach Sagely Monastery to speak to a Dharma Master. I told her the reason why I needed to talk to her; suddenly, on the another phone line, I heard a voice that I knew was the Master’s. Overwhelmed, I broke into tears and knelt down before the Buddha’s altar.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	I said in tears, “Master, please help us...we
								have kept this situation from our parents for we
								do not want them worry about us. Please help us,
								Master....”</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The Master’s compassionate response was indescribably potent as he transferred aid through me for Rhosita’s ailment. Before he hung up, he asked the Dharma Master if I was still crying. I was relieved and overjoyed. Never in my life had I ever encountered anyone as humble and benevolent as the Venerable Master. My conversation with the Master was a miracle and an unforgettable experience. In fact, I didn’t know that the Master was in Long Beach Sagely Monastery on that day.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">
                              	The following morning, Rhosita called me and I told her to follow the Master’s instructions by reciting Guanyin’s name a full ten thousand times. When she had her final physical exam, the doctors found that the cyst has disappeared. The situation puzzled the doctors. They set another date to verify their test conclusively, and the result showed no sign of the presence of the cyst.</p>
                            <p class="articleb">	On January 17, 1994, at Long Beach Sagely Monastery, Rhosita took refuge with the Triple Jewel and received the Dharma name Kuo Mong,
							“Dreamer.” Since she was residing in Switzerland at the time, my daughter, Hazel, took refuge on her behalf through the Master’s generous and compassionate consent.</p>
