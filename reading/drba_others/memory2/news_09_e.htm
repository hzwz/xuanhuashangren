							&#58921;We were surprised and deeply grieved to learn of the manifestation of stillness by the contemporary high an, Venerable Master Hsuan Hua.
                            <br>&#58921;The Venerable Master Hua’s virtue was lofty and exalted. He toiled to establish the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas. He propagated the Dharma to benefit living beings. He devoted his whole life to his nation and to Buddhism. His merit will be remembered for thousands of years.
                            <br>&#58921;Today is the Memorial and Cremation Ceremony for the Venerable Master Hua. We ask Dharma Master Mingyang to represent this Association in expressing our deep condolence. We wish that after a temporary rest in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Venerable Master will ride on his vows and come back soon to extensively rescue all sentient beings.

The Venerable Master was a contemporary great master, and people in China and abroad respected him as one of great virtue. Throughout his life he practiced ascetism and cultivated the three studies of precepts, samadhi, and wisdom together. Although his affinities in teaching are finished and he has returned to the Land of Eternal Stillness and Light, as his disciples we have not repaid his kindness, so we are weeping in sadness. We should transform our sadness and pain into vigor and practice in accord with his teaching, using that to repay the four types of kindness.

                                  <p class="articleb">It was with great sorrow that my husband and I learned of the death of the Venerable Abbot. Our family grieves with you and shares your loss. The Venerable Abbot was, and will continue to be, a guide to so many people in their spiritual life and surely an inspiration to people around the world. On a more personal note, he was the mentor for our son, Dharma Master Heng Sure, and we are proud that we can call him our friend. </p>
                                  <p class="articleb">Since the early days of the group at Gold Mountain Monastery, the Venerable Abbot has been the leader of Heng Sure and the other young people who gathered around him for his wisdom and guidance. With his leadership, the organization has grown in influence and stature. We remember the excitement of finding the facilities that became the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and other widely scattered temples that now are part of the Dharma Realm. With each new monastery came a new group of these followers to uphold the standards the Abbot has set.</p>
                                  <p class="articleb">We remember the Venerable Abbot as a kind, gentle man who never let sentiment stand in the way of teaching a lesson. My husband and I were very concerned when Heng Sure and Heng Ch’au set out on the Three Steps One Bow pilgrimage. Later, when we met the Abbot, we felt his deep compassion and knew that he and the Dharma had protected the monks on their journey.</p>
								<p class="articleb">Even though our meetings were few, we will miss the Venerable Abbot. His presence was always felt, and we are sure it will continue to be. You have been fortunate to have had such a remarkable person in your lives.</p>

                                  <p class="articleb">In response to your request, I am writing to relate our experiences with the late departed Venerable Master Hsuan Hua. In 1973 I was enrolled in Dr. Ronald Epstein’s class in Buddhism at San Francisco State University. That September, at a seminar he hosted, my wife and I viewed the Master for the first time. When the meeting ended, we got up from our seats and stood in the aisle. At that moment we saw the Master rushing up towards us, an enormous smile on his face. We were overwhelmed and turned and ran from the room.</p>
                                  <p class="articleb">We felt terrified, amazed; never had someone looked through us like that. I had felt absolutely naked with my every fault exposed. And from that moment on everything changed. We both agreed that this man displayed awesome powers and must certainly represent the true dharma. We started investigating Chan and Pure Land Buddhism. Several months afterwards we experienced insights that were sudden and profound.</p>
                                  <p class="articleb">During the winter session in 1981-82 at Wan Fwo Chan, we took refuge with the Master before the Dharma Assembly in the 10,000 Buddhas Hall. As an artist, I was moved to begin painting a portrait of the Master in seated meditation, against the backdrop of a view of the bay area from on high, looking at the sun rise over the Berkeley Hills. It was to represent the true dharma arising in the west.</p>
                                  <p class="articleb">For some reason it was never completed. The years went by, and even though we constantly cultivated mindfulness and followed the dharma, I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. Several weeks ago while in my art studio, I was suddenly compelled to bow three times before the picture and heard myself take a vow to complete the picture once and for all. This seemed a strange occurrence, and I mentioned it to my wife. One week later we received your newsletter and learned for the first time that the Master had died. This, combined with the incident I just mentioned, caused me immense sorrow as well as astonishment. We immediately made plans and went up to Wan Fwo Chan to bow and pay our respects the following Saturday. Afterwards we felt as though a great wave of energy had passed over and through us.</p>

	&#58921;The Elder Dharma Master Hua’s completion of stillness has left us in extreme grief. We are pained to lose such a Greatly Virtuous One. The Elder Dharma Master was renowned in China and abroad for his virtue and observance of precepts. The merit and virtue of his propagation of Dharma in America is truly monumental.<br>
	&#58921;I hope all of you Dharma Masters will transform your pain and sorrow into strength and unite singlemindedly to establish monasteries, carry on the Elder Dharma Master’s resolves, propagate the Buddhadharma, and protect the Way-place.

                                  <p class="articleb">When Upasakas Zhou Xuande and Zhu Shilung were alive, through their introduction I met the Great Master Hua several times and received much praise and encouragement from him. After the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas was completed in Ukiah, I went with my wife, daughter, and son-in-law to worship the Buddhas there. This year Professor Yang Fusen notified me of the Venerable Master’s birthday celebration and said the Master might come to Long Beach to attend the celebration. I was planning to go. But the Venerable Master, for reasons of poor health, was unable to receive the worship of the guests from all directions. When I received the obituary from Professor Yang, my grief knew no bounds. I have sent a couplet in mourning to express my respect.</p>

                                <p class="articleb">Further, the Venerable Master instructed that his ashes be scattered in empty space out of a wish to be modest and frugal. However, I wonder if you could take the feelings of the faithful laity in the ten directions into consideration, and bury the Master’s ashes according to ordinary custom, without building a temple or pagoda. That would be more economical than scattering the ashes in space, which would require a plane. Please consider this suggestion.</p>

								<em>We can trace his name back to the shores of the Sea of Liao.<br>
In this time when it is so difficult to propagate the Dharma,<br>
Where can we hear the Lion’s Roar again?<br>
To save the world, one must have cultivation as a basis.<br>
Gazing at the chaos and disorder all around,<br>
I send my recollections far away to Vulture Peak in the clouds.
