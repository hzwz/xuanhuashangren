                            <p class="articleb">Ever since we received news of the Venerable Master Hua’s completion of stillness, those of us in Seremban, Negeri
							Sembilan, Malaysia who had taken refuge with the
							Venerable Master and have Dharma names beginning
							with “Guo,” as well as other followers, were shocked and saddened. An eminent monk of this age came to the Saha World and spared no effort to propagate the great Dharma during the several decades that he was here. Wherever he went, he set up Way-places and temples and accepted left-home disciples on a vast scale. At the Sagely City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in America, he established a university, secondary schools, and elementary schools. Attracting worthy and virtuous people, he set up the Institute for the Translation of Buddhist Texts and propagated the Dharma to benefit beings and perpetuate the Buddhas’ wisdom. And when his conditions with this Saha world came to an end, he left the world and returned to the Buddhaland.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	The Venerable Master came to Malaysia a total of four times to propagate the Dharma. He lectured on the Proper Dharma, stirred up interest in meditation, and won the admiration of the multitudes. Under the influence of the Venerable Master’s kindness and virtue, everyone wholeheartedly took refuge in, believed, accepted, and upheld the Buddhadharma. Bestowing the sweet dew and Dharma rain upon living beings, he roused the minds of people throughout the society. The Buddhists who gathered to hear him numbered in the tens of thousands. Attracted by what they heard, people were inspired to become good.                            </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	Great compassion, great wisdom, and great courage─these are the three great powers of the Buddha. The Venerable Master Hua compassionately turned the boat around and came to universally save living beings. He propagated the proper Dharma to the people in the East and West, and his renown spread throughout the Dharma Realm. That was the three great powers in action. I and all followers look up to the Master, respectfully make obeisance, and with utmost sincerity protect the Triple Jewel and practice according to the teachings, in the hope of leaving suffering and attaining bliss.                             </p>
                            <p class="articleb">	From reading our kind Teacher’s instructional talks, I have realized the values of human life and come to understand the boundlessness of the Buddha Way. I am grateful to the Buddha’s kindness, and I thank the Venerable Master for the teaching of three words that he left me─patience, the Buddha, and the Dharma─which constantly inspires me in my ignorance.</p>

                              After hearing of the Venerable Master Hua’s completion of stillness on June 7, 1995, a group of disciples in Seremban, Negeri
								Sembilan, Malaysia, who had taken refuge with
								the Master and had Dharma names beginning with “Guo,” immediately called a meeting and began to make arrangements to set up an altar to the Venerable Master. On July 2 at 9:00 a.m., at the Buddhist Association of Negeri Sembilan, under the leadership of the Elder Master Venerable Ji Noble Huang, Chairman of the Malaysian Buddhist Association and Buddhist Association of Negeri Sembilan, as well as Dharma Masters Kaiji, Wuhui, Dongan, Zhaoyuan, Kaixin, and Kaiyin, the assembly of over two hundred lay followers single-mindedly recited the Buddha Speaks of Amitabha Sutra. At 1:00 p.m., Dharma Master Kaiji led the assembly in bowing the Vajra Jewelled Repentance and dedicated the merit to the Venerable Master. The Way-place on that day was solemn and adorned, and there was a sublime feeling that was very touching. The Dharma session ended at 4:00 p.m. We only pray the Venerable Master Hua will come back on his vows to teach and save living beings. </p>
                            <p class="articleb"><small>A committee for setting up the altar for worshipping the Venerable Master Hua and organizing the Dharma session for reciting Sutras and bowing in repentance was initiated by Li Guoping and Zhang Guomei.</small></p>
