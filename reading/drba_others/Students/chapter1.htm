                by rules (gui ju)? Gui is a compass used for drawing circles, ju          
                is a ruler used for drawing lines. Without the tools of a          
                compass and a ruler, it is not possible to draw a straight line          
                or a perfectly round circle. Therefore, anything that can serve          
                as a basis or a standard can be called a rule (gui ju). What is          
                this set of rules based upon? It is based upon the teachings of

                <p class="commentary4">This quote will be          
                explained later on. A sage (sheng ren) not only has great          
                learning, but he also has a lofty character. If a person is          
                intelligent and learned but lacks virtue, then his intelligence          
                and learning become tools for committing evil; he would be like          
                a tiger with wings. A tiger is already fearsome to begin with,          
                but if it has wings and is able to fly, then it will be able to          
                fly freely and do whatever it wants. Therefore, being virtuous          
                is far more important than having great scholarship and skills.          
                That is why, in the introductory chapter, it is necessary to          
                place virtue and morality before scholarship and skills. When          
                sages teach and transform people, they also hope that each          
                person can become a sage and a virtuous person.&nbsp;</td>

                所谓：“众生皆有佛性，皆堪作佛”、“人皆可以为尧舜”，佛是大智慧的人所成的，而这个大智慧是众生本具的，只是自己不知道，被无明障蔽了；现在我们只要能依教奉行，按照佛智慧的教导，就能够开发本有的智慧，也变得像佛一样有智慧，那就是成佛了！而尧和舜，是古代两个有名的圣王，仁慈又孝顺，我们只要按照他们的标准去学习，去实行，我们也可以和他们一样有道德，这不就是成了圣人了吗？所以孔子把这一套道德的标准流传下来。好让我们根据它来学习。</td>

                <p class="commentary4"> There is a          
                saying in Buddhism: &quot;All living beings have the Buddha-nature          
                and can become Buddhas.&quot; There is another saying in Chinese:          
                &quot;All men can become like Yao and Shun.&quot; The Buddha was a person          
                of great wisdom who realized Buddhahood. This great wisdom is          
                inherent in all living beings, but we don't realize this because          
                we are covered by ignorance. If we can put the Buddha's          
                teachings of wisdom into practice now, we will develop our          
                inherent wisdom, and when that wisdom becomes the same as the          
                Buddha's wisdom, we will have realized Buddhahood. Yao and Shun          
                were two famous sage-kings in ancient China who were known for          
                being humane, kind, and filial. If we could learn from them and          
                follow their standards, we can also become as virtuous as they          
                were--and won't that make us sages as well? And so Confucius          
                handed down the standards of virtue, giving us the chance to          
                learn from them.</td>

                young, he always helped his mother with the chores and learned         
                various skills in the process. Moreover, Confucius pursued         
                knowledge with great diligence. Whether it was practical         
                knowledge from daily life or knowledge found in books, he would         
                actively study and seek to practice what he learned. In this way         
                he developed his extraordinary character and attained the wealth

                concerned with self-cultivation, he also wished to help others

                students based on the principle that &quot;in education there should         
                be no distinctions of class.&quot; He never indulged in the slightest         
                discrimination based on the backgrounds, intelligence, or         
                abilities of his students. Anyone who wished to study with him,         
                as long as he prepared a token gift for the teacher according lo         
                etiquette, would be accepted.</td>

                their dispositions. Based on the sharpness of their faculties         
                and the measure of their minds, as well as on their various         
                backgrounds and situations, he would give them individualized         
                teachings that were easy to understand but contained deep         
                meaning. He taught without weariness. Confucius never felt         
                tired, never became impatient, and never thought about taking a         
                rest. Therefore, many of his students became capable and         
                productive people, and the Confucian school of thought has been         
                handed down through the generations, becoming the mainstream of         
                Chinese civilization. Later generations have honored Confucius         
                as &quot;the greatest sage and teacher,&quot; meaning that he was the         
                greatest and most virtuous teacher of the past.&nbsp;</td>
