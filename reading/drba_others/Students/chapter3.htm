                <p class="commentary4">&nbsp;Brothers and sisters were born from    
                the same parents. They are like the branches of a tree: Although    
                they grow up separately, they originally come form the same    
                root. We should never bicker and hurt each other's feelings. Why    
                not? Because time flies. Pretty soon we will have our own    
                families and careers, and we'll hardly get a chance to see each    
                other. Every time we meet, we will be shocked to see that the    
                other has gotten older. Human life only lasts a few short    
                decades; how much longer will we have each other as siblings? If    
                we don't get along when we're still young, then after we grow up    
                we will bicker whenever we meet. But will we still have the    
                strength to fight when we have wrinkles and gray hair? When we    
                die, will we bring our grudges to the underworld? There's an    
                ancient saying: &quot;The affinity of riding in the same boat with    
                someone took five hundred years to develop.&quot; How much more time    
                it must take to develop the affinity to be someone's brother or    
                sister? Think about it: these are not minor conditions! All    
                human relationships begin with that of husband and wife; then    
                there is the vertical relationship of parent to child, and the    
                horizontal relationship between siblings. These three basic    
                relationships, which give rise to the nine generations of    
                relatives, are considered one's closest kin. How can we not he    
                affectionate and close to them?</p></td>

，难以真正开心；孩子们若再互相残害，那做父母的就更不会安心了！所以懂得孝道真谛的，一定亲厚自己的兄弟姐妹，绝不相争；甚至在自己发达时，也不忘提拔照顾自己的兄弟姐妹，绝不相忘。</p></td>

                <p class="commentary4">The Chinese refer to brothers and sisters as "those of the same womb" and "hands and feet," emphasizing how important and inseparable our siblings are to us. Parents often compare their children to the fingers of a hand. Although the fingers are of different lengths, they are all connected at the base, and it hurts the same no matter which one is bitten. Children may be wise or foolish, filial or unfilial, but they are just like the palm and the back of the hand, which are part of the same hand. One child maybe wealthy and honored, while another is poor and lowly, but even though the    
                wealthy one provides his parents with fine clothing and food, his parents can hardly feel happy in their anxiety over the less fortunate one. And if the children mutually hurt each other, how much the less could the parents be happy. A child who truly understands how to be filial is kind and affectionate to his siblings and would never quarrel with them. If such a child is successful in life, he/she will not forget to help out and lake care of his siblings.</p></td>

When Cao Pi assumed the throne, he removed the Han emperor and became the emperor himself and plotted constantly to kill Cao Zhi. Although his mother was the Empress Dowager, she was so nervous about this that she could never sleep in peace. Finally Cao Pi banished his younger brother to a distant land. When Cao Zhi went to court to bid farewell. Cao Pi deliberately challenged him to compose a poem in seven steps; if his brother failed, he would use it as a pretext to execute him. Unexpectedly, in the short time it took to walk seven steps, Cao Zhi chanted this famous "Seven-step Poem"：

After he assumed the throne, he renovated the residence he had used when he was a prince, building a tower which he called "The Mutual Shining of Flower and Calyx" there. On the four sides he built five palaces which he conferred upon his four brothers and a cousin. He called them "The Houses of the Five Kings."

If any one of his brothers got sick, he would not be able to eat or sleep in peace, and would constantly inquire after him. Once when he was boiling medicinal herbs for his little brother, he even burned his beard by accident. The things people like to tell about most are his "Flower and Calyx Blanket" and "Flower and Calyx Bed"-he had a long pillow, large blanket, and large six-person bed custom-made so that he and his brothers could sleep under the same covers.
